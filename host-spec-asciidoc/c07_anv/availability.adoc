=== Availability

[#sect-availability-votes]
==== Availability Votes

The Polkadot validator must issue a bitfield (<<defn-bitfield-array>>) which
indicates votes for the availabilty of candidates. Issued bitfields can be used
by the validator and other peers to determine which backed candidates meet the
2/3+ availability quorum.

Candidates are inserted into the relay chain in form of parachain inherent data
(<<sect-candidate-inclusion>>) by a block author. A validator can retrieve that
data by calling the appropriate Runtime API entry
(<<sect-rt-api-availability-cores>>), then create a bitfield indicating for
which candidate the validator has availability data stored and broadcast it to
the network as defined in Definition 7.38. When sending the bitfield distrubtion
message, the validator must ensure stem:[B_h] is set approriately, therefore
clarifying to which state the bitfield is referring to, given that candidates
can vary based on the chain fork.

Missing availability data of candidates must be recovered by the validator as
described in <<sect-candidate-recovery>>. If previously issued bitfields are
no longer accurate, i.e. the availability data has been recovered or the
candidate of an availablity core has changed, the validator must create a new
bitfield and boradcast it to the network. Candidates must be kept available by
validators for a specific amount of time. If a candidate does not receive any
backing, validators should keep it available for about one hour, in case the
state of backing does change. Backed and even approved candidates
(<<sect-approval-voting>>) must be kept by validators for about 25 hours, since
disputes (TODO) can occur and the candidate needs to be checked again.

The validator issues availability votes in form of a validator protocol message
(<<net-msg-collator-protocol-message>>).

[#sect-candidate-recovery]
==== Candidate Recovery

The availability distribution of the Polkadot validator must be able to recover
parachain candidates that the validator is assigned to, in order to determine
whether the candidate should be backed (<<sect-candidate-backing>>) respectively
whether the candidate should be approved (<<sect-approval-voting>>).
Additionally, peers can send availability requests as defined in
<<net-msg-chunk-fetching-request>> and <<net-msg-available-data-request>> to the
validator, which the validator should be able to respond to.

Candidates are recovered by sending requests for specific indices of erasure
encoded chunks. Erasure encoding is described in Section TODO. A validator
should request chunks by picking peers randomly and must recover at least
stem:[f+1] chunks, where stem:[n=3f+k] and stem:[k in {1,2,3}]. stem:[n] is the
number of validators as specified in the session info, which can be fetched by
the Runtime API as described in <<sect-rt-api-session-info>>.
