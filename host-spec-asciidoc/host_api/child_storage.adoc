==== Child Storage
****
*Child storage* key is a unprefixed location of the child trie in the main trie.
****

==== `ext_default_child_storage_set`
Sets the value under a given key into the child storage.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
----
(func $ext_default_child_storage_set_version_1

----

Arguments::

* `child_storage_key` : a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>) indicating the
child storage key as defined in Definition
link_defn-child-storage-type++defn-child-storage-type]].
* `key`: a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>) indicating the key. (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>)
link_defn-runtime-pointer-size++defn-runtime-pointer-size]] indicating the
value.

==== `ext_default_child_storage_get`
Retrieves the value associated with the given key from the child storage.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
----
(func $ext_default_child_storage_get_version_1

----

Arguments::

* `child_storage_key`: a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>) indicating the
child storage key as defined in Definition

* `key`: a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>) indicating the key. 
* `result`: a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>) indicating the SCALE
encoded _Option_ value containing the value.

==== `ext_default_child_storage_read`

Gets the given key from storage, placing the value into a buffer and returning
the number of bytes that the entry in storage has beyond the offset.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
----
(func $ext_default_child_storage_read_version_1
	(param $child_storage_key i64) (param $key i64) (param $value_out i64)

link_defn-runtime-pointer-size++defn-runtime-pointer-size]] indicating the
buffer to which the value will be written to. This function will never write
more then the length of the buffer, even if the valueâ€™s length is bigger.
* `offset`: an u32 integer containing the offset beyond the value should be read
from.
* `result`: a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>) indicating the SCALE
encoded _Option_ value (<<defn-option-type>>) containing the number of bytes
written into the *value_out* buffer. Returns if the entry does not exists.

==== `ext_default_child_storage_clear`

Clears the storage of the given key and its value from the child storage.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
----
(func $ext_default_child_storage_clear_version_1
	(param $child_storage_key i64) (param $key i64))

child storage key as defined in Definition
link_defn-child-storage-type++defn-child-storage-type]].

child storage key as defined in Definition
link_defn-child-storage-type++defn-child-storage-type]].

==== `ext_default_child_storage_exists`

Checks whether the given key exists in the child storage.

child storage key as defined in Defintion
link_defn-child-storage-type++defn-child-storage-type]].
* `key`: a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>) indicating the key.
* `return`: an i32 integer value equal to _1_ if the key exists or a value equal
to _0_ if otherwise.

==== `ext_default_child_storage_clear_prefix`

Clears the child storage of each key/value pair where the key starts with the
given prefix.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
