=== Trie

Interface that provides trie related functionality.

==== `ext_trie_blake2_256_root`

Compute a 256-bit Blake2 trie root formed from the iterated items.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
----
(func $ext_trie_blake2_256_root_version_1
	(param $data i64) (result i32))
----

Arguments::

* `data`: a pointer-size as defined in Definition
link_defn-runtime-pointer-size++defn-runtime-pointer-size]] indicating the
iterated items from which the trie root gets formed. The items consist of a
SCALE encoded array containing arbitrary key/value pairs.
* `result`: a 32-bit pointer to the buffer containing the 256-bit trie root.

==== `ext_trie_blake2_256_ordered_root`

Compute a 256-bit Blake2 trie root formed from the enumerated items.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
----
(func $ext_trie_blake2_256_ordered_root_version_1
	(param $data i64) (result i32))
----

Arguments::

* `data`: a pointer-size as defined in Definition
link_defn-runtime-pointer-size++defn-runtime-pointer-size]] indicating the
enumerated items from which the trie root gets formed. The items consist of a
SCALE encoded array containing only values, where the corresponding key of each
value is the index of the item in the array, starting at 0. The keys are compact
encoded integers as described in Definition
link_defn-sc-len-encoding++defn-sc-len-encoding]].
* `result`: a 32-bit pointer to the buffer containing the 256-bit trie root
result.

==== `ext_trie_keccak_256_root`

Compute a 256-bit Keccak trie root formed from the iterated items.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
----
(func $ext_trie_keccak_256_root_version_1
	(param $data i64) (result i32))

SCALE encoded array containing arbitrary key/value pairs.
* `result`: a 32-bit pointer to the buffer containing the 256-bit trie root.

==== `ext_trie_keccak_256_ordered_root`

Compute a 256-bit Keccak trie root formed from the enumerated items.
