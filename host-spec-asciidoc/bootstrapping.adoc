This chapter provides an overview over the tasks a Polkadot Host needs to
performs in order to join and participate in the Polkadot network. While this
chapter does not go into any new specifications of the protocol, it has been
included to provide implementors with a pointer to what these steps are and
where they are defined. In short, the following steps should be taken by all
bootstrapping nodes:

. The node needs to populate the state storage with the official Genesis state
which can be obtained from .
. The node should maintains a set of around 50 active peers at any time. New
peers can be found using the discovery protocols (Section
link:#sect-discovery-mechanism[4.4])
. The node should open and maintain the various required streams (Section
link:#sect-protocols-substreams[4.7]) with each of its active peers.
. Furthermore, the node should send block requests (Section
link:#sect-msg-block-request[4.8.2]) to these peers to receive all blocks in the
chain and execute each of them.
. Exchange neighbor packets (Section link:#sect-grandpa-neighbor-msg[4.8.4.3])

Validator nodes should take the following, additional steps.

. Verify that the Host’s session key is included in the current Epoch’s
authority set (Section link:#sect-authority-set[6.1.1]).
. Run the BABE lottery (Section
link:#sect-block-production[[sect-block-production]]) and wait for the next
assigned slot in order to produce a block.
. Gossip any produced blocks to all connected peers (Section
link:#sect-msg-block-announce[4.8.1]).
. Run the catch-up protocol (Section link:#sect-grandpa-catchup[6.4.1]) to make
sure that the node is participating in the current round and not a past round.
. Run the GRANDPA rounds protocol (Section link:#sect-finality[6.3]).
