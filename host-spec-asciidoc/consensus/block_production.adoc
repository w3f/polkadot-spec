=== Block Production

The Polkadot Host uses BABE protocol for block production. It is designed based
on Ouroboros praos . BABE execution happens in sequential non-overlapping phases
known as an *_epoch_*. Each epoch on its turn is divided into a predefined
number of slots. All slots in each epoch are sequentially indexed starting from
0. At the beginning of each epoch, the BABE node needs to run Algorithm
link:#algo-block-production-lottery[[algo-block-production-lottery]] to find out
in which slots it should produce a block and gossip to the other block
producers. In turn, the block producer node should keep a copy of the block tree
and grow it as it receives valid blocks from other block producers. A block
producer prunes the tree in parallel by eliminating branches that do not include
the most recent finalized blocks according to Definition
link:#defn-pruned-tree[[defn-pruned-tree]].

==== Preliminaries

===== Block Producer
A *block producer*, noted by stem:[cc "P"_j], is a node running the Polkadot
Host which is authorized to keep a transaction queue and which it gets a turn in
producing blocks.

===== Block Authoring Session Key Pair
*Block authoring session key pair* stem:[(sk_j^s,pk_j^s)] is an SR25519 key pair
which the block producer stem:[cc "P"_j] signs by their account key (see Definition
link:#defn-account-key[[defn-account-key]]) and is used to sign the produced
block as well as to compute its lottery values in Algorithm
link:#algo-block-production-lottery[[algo-block-production-lottery]].

[#defn-epoch-slot]
===== Epoch
****
A block production *epoch*, formally referred to as stem:[cc "E"], is a
period with a pre-known starting time and fixed-length during which the set of
block producers stays constant. Epochs are indexed sequentially, and we refer to
the stem:[n^(th)] epoch since genesis by stem:[cc "E"_n]. Each epoch is divided
into equal-length periods known as block production *slots*, sequentially
indexed in each epoch. The index of each slot is called a *slot number*. The
equal length duration of each slot is called the *slot duration* and indicated
by stem:[cc "T"]. Each slot is awarded to a subset of block producers during
which they are allowed to generate a block.

IMPORTANT: Substrate refers to an epoch as ``session'' in some places, however,
epoch should be the preferred and official name for these periods.
****

[#note-slot]
===== Slot duration
****
We refer to the number of slots in epoch stem:[cc "E"_n] by stem:[sc_n].
stem:[sc_n] is set to the `duration` field in the returned data from the call of
the Runtime entry `BabeApi_configuration` (see
link:#sect-rte-babeapi-epoch[13.3.8.1]) at genesis. For a given block stem:[B],
we use the notation *latexmath:[$s_B$]* to refer to the slot during which
stem:[B] has been produced. Conversely, for slot stem:[s], stem:[cc "B"_c] is
the set of Blocks generated at slot stem:[s].

Definition link:#defn-epoch-subchain[[defn-epoch-subchain]] provides an
iterator over the blocks produced during a specific epoch.
****

[#defn-epoch-subchain]
===== Epoch Subchain
****
By stem:["SubChain"(cc "E"_n]) for epoch stem:[cc "E"_n], we refer to the path
graph of stem:[BT] containing all the blocks generated during the slots of epoch
stem:[cc "E"_n]. When there is more than one block generated at a slot, we
choose the one which is also on stem:["Longest-Chain"(BT)].
****

===== Equivocation
****
A block producer *equivocates* if they produce more than one block at the same
slot. The proof of equivocation are the given distinct headers that were signed
by the validator and which include the slot number.

The Polkadot Host must detect equivocations committed by other
validators and submit those to the Runtime as described in Section
link:#sect-babeapi_submit_report_equivocation_unsigned_extrinsic[13.3.8.6].
****

==== Block Production Lottery

The babe constant (Definition link:#defn-babe-constant[[defn-babe-constant]]) is
initialized at genesis to the value returned by calling `BabeApi_configuration`
(see link:#sect-rte-babeapi-epoch[13.3.8.1]). For efficiency reasons, it is
generally updated by the Runtime through the "Next Config Data" consensus
message (see Definition
link:#defn-consensus-message-digest[[defn-consensus-message-digest]]) in the
digest of the first block of an epoch for the next epoch.

A block producer aiming to produce a block during stem:[cc "E"_n] should run
Algorithm link:#algo-block-production-lottery[[algo-block-production-lottery]]
to identify the slots it is awarded. These are the slots during which the block
producer is allowed to build a block. The stem:[sk] is the block producer
lottery secret key and stem:[n] is the index of the epoch for whose slots
the block producer is running the lottery.

[#defn-babe-constant]
===== BABE Constant
****
The *BABE constant* stem:[c in (0,1)] is the probability that a slot will not be
empty and used in the winning threshold calculation (see Definition
link:#defn-winning-threshold[[defn-winning-threshold]]).
****

[#defn-winning-threshold]
===== Winning Threshold
****
The *Winning threshold* denoted by stem:[T_(cc "E"_n)] is the threshold that is used
alongside the result of Algorithm
link:#algo-block-production-lottery[[algo-block-production-lottery]] to decide
if a block producer is the winner of a specific slot. stem:[T_(cc "E"_n)] is
calculated Â as follows:

[stem]
++++
T_(E_n) := 1 - (1 - c)^(1/("AuthorityDirectory"^(E_n)))
++++

where the stem:["AuthorityDirectory"^(cc "E"_n)] is the set of BABE
authorities for epoch stem:[cc "E"_n] and stem:[c in (0, 1)] is the BABE
constant as defined in definition
link:#defn-babe-constant[[defn-babe-constant]].
****

TODO: Algorithm

For any slot stem:[i] in epoch stem:[n] where stem:[d < r], the block producer
is required to produce a block. For the definitions of _Epoch-Randomness_ and
_VRF_ functions, see Section link:#sect-epoch-randomness[6.2.5] and Section
link:#sect-vrf[9.4] respectively.

[#sect-slot-number-calculation]
==== Slot Number Calculation

It is imperative for the security of the network that each block producer
correctly determines the current slot numbers at a given time by regularly
estimating the local clock offset in relation to the network (Definition
link:#defn-relative-syncronization[[defn-relative-syncronization]]).

****
NOTE: *The calculation described in this section is still to be implemented and
deployed*: For now, each block producer is required to synchronize its local
clock using NTP instead. The current slot stem:[s] is then calculated by stem:[s
= t_("unix")/cc "T"] where stem:[t_("unix")] is the current UNIX time in seconds
since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. That also entails that slot numbers are currently
not reset at the beginning of each epoch.

TODO: What is stem:[cc "T"]?
****

Polkadot does this synchronization without relying on any external clock source
(e.g. through the or the ). To stay in synchronization, each producer is
therefore required to periodically estimate its local clock offset in relation
to the rest of the network.

This estimation depends on the two fixed parameters stem:[k] (Definition
link:#defn-prunned-best[[defn-prunned-best]]) and stem:[s_(cq)] (Definition
link:#defn-chain-quality[[defn-chain-quality]]). These are chosen based on the
results of a formal security analysis, currently assuming a stem:[1 s]clock
drift per day and targeting a probability lower than stem:[0.5%] for an
adversary to break BABE in 3 years with resistance against a network delay up to
stem:[1 / 3] of the slot time and a Babe constant (Definition
link:#defn-babe-constant[[defn-babe-constant]]) of stem:[c = 0.38].

All validators are then required to run Algorithm
link:#algo-slot-time[[algo-slot-time]] at the beginning of each sync period
(Definition link:#defn-sync-period[[defn-sync-period]]) to update their
synchronization using all block arrival times of the previous period. The
algorithm should only be run once all the blocks in this period have been
finalized, even if only probabilistically (Definition
link:#defn-prunned-best[[defn-prunned-best]]). The target slot to which to
synchronize should be the first slot in the new sync period.

TODO: Algorithm

[#defn-slot-offset]
===== Slot Offset
****
Let stem:[s_i] and stem:[s_j] be two slots belonging to epochs stem:[cc "E"_k]
and stem:[cc "E"_l]. By *Slot-Offset*stem:[(s_i,s_j)] we refer to the function
whose value is equal to the number of slots between stem:[s_i] and stem:[s_j]
(counting stem:[s_j]) on the time continuum. As such, we have
*Slot-Offset*stem:[(s_i, s_i) = 0].

It is imperative for the security of the network that each block
producer correctly determines the current slot numbers at a given time
by regularly estimating the local clock offset in relation to the
network (Definition
link:#defn-relative-syncronization[[defn-relative-syncronization]]).
****

[#defn-relative-syncronization]
===== Relative Time Synchronization
****
The *relative time synchronization* is a tuple of a slot number and a local
clock timestamp stem:[(s_("sync"),t_("sync"))] describing the last point at
which the slot numbers have been synchronized with the local clock.

TODO: Algorithm
****

[#defn-prunned-best]
===== Pruned Best Chain
****
The *pruned best chain* stem:[C^(r^k)] is the longest chain selected according
to Definition link:#defn-longest-chain[[defn-longest-chain]] with the last
stem:[k] Blocks pruned. We chose stem:[k = 140]. The *last (probabilistic)
finalized block* describes the last block in this pruned best chain.
****

[#defn-chain-quality]
===== Chain Quality
****
The *chain quality* stem:[s_(cq)] represents the number of slots that are used
to estimate the local clock offset. Currently, it is set to stem:[s_(cq) =
3000].

The prerequisite for such a calculation is that each producer stores the arrival
time of each block (Definition link:#defn-block-time[[defn-block-time]])
measured by a clock that is otherwise not adjusted by any external protocol.
****

[#defn-block-time]
===== Block Arrival Time
The *block arrival time* of block stem:[B] for node stem:[j] formally
represented by stem:[T^j_B] is the local time of node stem:[j] when node
stem:[j] has received block stem:[B] for the first time. If the node stem:[j]
itself is the producer of stem:[B], stem:[T_B^j] is set equal to the time that
the block is produced. The index stem:[j] in stem:[T^j_B] notation may be
dropped and Bâs arrival time is referred to by stem:[T_B] when there is no
ambiguity about the underlying node.

WARNING: Currently it still lacks a clear definition of when block arrival times
are considered valid and how to differentiated imported block on initial sync
from ``fresh'' blocks that were just produced.

[#defn-sync-period]
===== Sync Period
A is an interval at which each validator (re-)evaluates its local clock offsets.
The first sync period stem:[fr "E"_1] starts just after the genesis block is
released. Consequently, each sync period stem:[fr "E"_i] starts after stem:[fr
"E"_(i - 1)]. The length of the sync period is equal to stem:[s_(qc)] as defined
in Definition link:#defn-chain-quality[[defn-chain-quality]] and expressed in
the number of slots.

[#block-production]
==== Block Production
Throughout each epoch, each block producer should run Algorithm
link:#algo-block-production[[algo-block-production]] to produce blocks during
the slots it has been awarded during that epoch. The produced block needs to
carry the _BABE header_ as well as the _block signature_ as Pre-Runtime and Seal
digest items defined in Definition link:#defn-babe-header[[defn-babe-header]]
and link:#defn-block-signature[[defn-block-signature]] respectively.

[#defn-babe-header]
===== BABE Header
The *BABE Header* of block stem:[B], referred to formally by
stem:[H_("BABE")(B)] is a tuple and consists of the following components:

[stem]
++++
(d,pi,j,s)
++++

where:

* stem:[pi, d] are the results of the block lottery for slot stem:[s].
* stem:[j] is the index of the block producer in the authority directory of the
current epoch.
* stem:[s] is the slot at which the block is produced.

stem:[H_("BABE")(B)] must be included as a digest item of Pre-Runtime type in
the header digest stem:[H_d(B)] as defined in Definition
link:#defn-digest[[defn-digest]].

TODO: Algorithm

Add-Digest-Item appends a digest item to the end of the header digest
stem:[H_d(B)] according to Definition link:#defn-digest[[defn-digest]].

[#defn-block-signature]
===== Block Signature
***
The *Block Signature* stem:[S_B] is a signature of the block header hash (see
Definitionlink:#defn-block-header-hash[[defn-block-header-hash]]) and defined as

[stem]
++++
"Sig"_("SR25519","sk"_j^s)(H_h(B))
++++

stem:[S_B] should be included in stem:[H_d(B)] as the Seal digest item according
to Definition link:#defn-digest[[defn-digest]] of value:

[stem]
++++
(E_(id)("BABE"),S_B)
++++

in which, stem:[E_("id")("BABE")] is the BABE consensus engine unique identifier
defined in Definition
link:#defn-consensus-message-digest[[defn-consensus-message-digest]]. The Seal
digest item is referred to as the *BABE Seal*.
****

[#sect-epoch-randomness]
==== Epoch Randomness
****
At the beginning of each epoch, stem:[cc "E"_n] the host will receive the
randomness seed stem:[cc "R"_(cc "E"_(n+1))](Definition
link:#defn-epoch-randomness[[defn-epoch-randomness]]) necessary to participate
in the block production lottery in the next epoch stem:[cc "E"_(n+1)] from the
Runtime, through the consensus message (Definition
link:#defn-consensus-message-digest[[defn-consensus-message-digest]]) in the
digest of the first block.
****

[#defn-epoch-randomness]
===== Randomness Seed
****
For epoch stem:[cc "E"], there is a 32-byte stem:[cc "R"_(cc "E")] computed
based on the previous epochs VRF outputs. For stem:[cc "E"_0] and stem:[cc
"E"_1], the randomness seed is provided in the genesis state.
