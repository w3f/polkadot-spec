As clarified in Chapter 1, Polkadot serves as a replicated shared-state machine designed to resolve scalability issues and interoperability among blockchains. The validators of Polkadot execute transactions and participate in the consensus of Polkadots primary chain, the so called relay chain. Parachains are independent networks that maintain their own state and are connected to the relay chain. Those parachains can take advantage of the relay chain consensus mechanism, including sending and receiving messages to and from other parachains. Parachain nodes that send parachain blocks, known as candidates, to the validators in order to be inlcuded in relay chain are referred to as collators.

The Polkadot relay chain validators are responsible for guaranteeing the validity of both relay chain and parachain blocks. Additionally, the validators are required to keep enough parachain blocks that should be included in the relay chain available in their local storage in order to make those retrievable by peers, who lack the information, to reliably confirm the issued validity statements about parachain blocks. The Availability & Validity (AnV) protocol consists of multiple steps for successfully upholding those responsibilities.

Parachain blocks themselves are produced by collators (<<sect-collations>>), whereas the relay chain validators only verify their validity (and later, their availability). It is possible that the collators of a parachain  produces multiple parachain block candidates for a child of a specific block. Subsequently, they send the block candidates to the the relay chain validators who are assigned to the specific parachain. The assignment is determined by the Runtime (<<sect-candidate-backing>>). Those validators are then required to check the validity of submitted candidates (<<sect-candidate-validation>>), then issue and collect statements (<<sect-candidate-statements>>) about the validity of candidates to other validators. This process is known as candidate backing. Once a candidate meets a specified criteria for inclusion, the selected relay chain block author then choses any of the backed candidate for each parachain and includes those into the relay chain block (<<sect-candidate-inclusion>>).

Every relay chain validator must fetch the proposed candidates and issue votes on whether they have the candidate saved in their local storage, so called availability votes (<<sect-availability-votes>>), then also collect the votes sent by other validators and include them in the relay chain state (<<sect-candidate-inclusion>>). This process ensures that only relay chain blocks get finalized where each candidate is available on enough nodes of validators.

Parachain candidates contained in non-finalized (Section ?) relay chain blocks must then be retrieved by a secondary set of relay chain validators, unrelated from the candidate backing process, who are randomly assigned to determine the validity of specific parachains based on a VRF lottery and are then required to vote on the validity of those candidates. This process is known as approval voting
(<<sect-approval-voting>>). If a validator does not have the candidate data, it must recover the candidate data (<<sect-candidate-recovery>>).
