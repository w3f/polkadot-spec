# Polkadot Runtime Environment Spec
Incubator for Polkadot RE spec

Here your can find the latest version of ![Polkadot Runtime Environment Specification](./polkadot_re_spec.pdf) 

Please refer to ![Change log](./pdre_change_log.org) to review the history of changes to the spec.

Due to evolving nature of the protocol, to help the reader with identifying updates since last master released, those changes are marked in "green" (new version) vs "red" (old version) in ![polkadot_re_spec-diffed-updates.pdf](./polkadot_re_spec-diffed-updates.pdf).

## Editing

The specification is edited with [TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org/) with an
additional style package [algorithmacs-style.ts](./algorithmacs-style.ts)
([source](https://gitlab.com/syedahmad/algorithmacs))
that should be copied to your personal style package directory
`$HOME/.TeXmacs/packages`. The `.tex` and `.pdf` files are exported from
TeXmacs.
