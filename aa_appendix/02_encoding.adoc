=== Auxiliary Encodings

[#defn-unix-time]
.<<defn-unix-time, Unix Time>>
====
By *Unix time*, we refer to the unsigned, little-endian encoded 64-bit integer
which stores the number of *milliseconds* that have elapsed since the Unix
epoch, that is the time 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, minus leap seconds. Leap
seconds are ignored, and every day is treated as if it contained exactly 86’400
seconds.

==== Binary Enconding

[#defn-byte-sequence]
.<<defn-byte-sequence, Sequence of Bytes>>
====
By a *sequences of bytes* or a *byte array*, stem:[b], of length
stem:[n], we refer to

[stem]
++++
b := (b_0, b_1, ..., b_{n - 1}) " such that " 0 <= b_i <= 255
++++

We define stem:[bbb B_n] to be the
*set of all byte arrays of length stem:[n]*. Furthermore, we
define:

[stem]
++++
bbb B := uuu_(i=0)^infty bbb B_i
++++

We represent the concatenation of byte arrays
stem:[a :=(a_0, ..., a_n)] and
stem:[b :=(b_0, ..., b_m)] by:

[stem]
++++
a |\| b :=(a_0, ..., a_n, b_0, ..., b_m)
++++
====

[#defn-bit-rep]
.<<defn-bit-rep, Bitwise Representation>>
====
For a given byte stem:[0 <= b <= 255] the *bitwise representation* in bits stem:[b_i in {0, 1}] is defined as:

[stem]
++++
b := b_7 ... b_0
++++

where

[stem]
++++
b = 2^7 b_7 + 2^6 b_6 + ... + 2^0 b_0
++++
====

[#defn-little-endian]
.<<defn-little-endian, Little Endian>>
====
By the *little-endian* representation of a non-negative integer, stem:[I],
represented as

[stem]
++++
I = (B_n ... B_0)_256
++++

in base 256, we refer to a byte array
stem:[B = (b_0, b_1, ..., b_n)] such that

[stem]
++++
b_i :=B_i
++++

Accordingly, we define the function stem:[sf "Enc"_(sf "LE")]:

[stem]
++++
sf "Enc"_(sf "LE"): bbb Z^+ -> bbb B; (B_n ... B_0)_256 |-> (B_{0,} B_1, ... , B_n)
++++
====

[#defn-uint32]
.<<defn-uint32, UINT32>>
====
By *UINT32* we refer to a non-negative integer stored in a byte array of
length stem:[4] using little-endian encoding format.
====

[#sect-scale-codec]
==== SCALE Codec
The Polkadot Host uses _Simple Concatenated Aggregate Little-Endian” (SCALE)
codec_ to encode byte arrays as well as other data structures. SCALE provides a
canonical encoding to produce consistent hash values across their
implementation, including the Merkle hash proof for the State Storage.

[#defn-scale-decoding]
.<<defn-scale-decoding, Decoding>>
====
stem:["Dec"_("SC")(d)] refers to the decoding of a blob of data. Since the SCALE codec is not
self-describing, it’s up to the decoder to validate whether the blob of data can
be deserialized into the given type or data structure.

It's accepted behavior for the decoder to partially decode the blob of data.
Meaning, any additional data that does not fit into a datastructure can be
ignored.

WARNING: Considering that the decoded data is never larger than the encoded
message, this information can serve as a way to validate values that can vary in
sizes, such as sequences (<<defn-scale-list>>). The decoder should strictly use
the size of the encoded data as an upper bound when decoding in order to prevent
denial of service attacks.
====

[#defn-scale-tuple]
.<<defn-scale-tuple, Tuple>>
====
The *SCALE codec* for *Tuple*, stem:[T], such that:

[stem]
++++
T := (A_1,... A_n)
++++

Where stem:[A_i]’s are values of *different types*, is defined as:

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_("SC")(T) := "Enc"_("SC")(A_1) "||" "Enc"_("SC")(A_2) "||" ... "||" "Enc"_("SC")(A_n)
++++
====

In case of a tuple (or a structure), the knowledge of the shape of data is not
encoded even though it is necessary for decoding. The decoder needs to derive
that information from the context where the encoding/decoding is happening.

[#defn-varrying-data-type]
.<<defn-varrying-data-type, Varying Data Type>>
====
We define a *varying data* type to be an ordered set of data types.

[stem]
++++
cc T = {T_1, ..., T_n}
++++

A value stem:[A] of varying date type is a pair stem:[(A_("Type"),A_("Value"))]
where stem:[A_("Type") = T_i] for some stem:[T_i in cc T] and
stem:[A_("Value")] is its value of type stem:[T_i], which can be empty. We
define stem:["idx"(T_i) = i - 1], unless it is explicitly defined as another
value in the definition of a particular varying data type.

In particular, we define two specific varying data which are frequently used in
various part of Polkadot protocol: _Option_ (<<defn-option-type>>) and _Result_
(<<defn-result-type>>).
====

[#defn-scale-variable-type]
.<<defn-scale-variable-type, Encoding of Varying Data Type>>
====
The SCALE codec for value stem:[A = (A_("Type"), A_("Value"))] of varying data
type stem:[cc T = {T_i, ... T_n}], formally referred to as
stem:["Enc"_("SC")(A)] is defined as follows:

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_("SC")(A) := "Enc"_("SC")("idx"(A_("Type")) "||" "Enc"_("SC")(A_("Value")))
++++

Where stem:["idx"] is a 8-bit integer determining the type of stem:[A]. In
particular, for the optional type defined in <<defn-varrying-data-type>>, we
have:

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_("SC")("None", phi) := 0_(bbb B_1)
++++

The SCALE codec does not encode the correspondence between the value and the
data type it represents; the decoder needs prior knowledge of such
correspondence to decode the data.
====

[#defn-option-type]
.<<defn-option-type, Option Type>>
====
The *Option* type is a varying data type of stem:[{"None",T_2}] which indicates if
data of stem:[T_2] type is available (referred to as _some_ state) or not
(referred to as _empty_, _none_ or _null_ state). The presence of type _none_,
indicated by stem:["idx"(T_("None")) = 0], implies that the data corresponding
to stem:[T_2] type is not available and contains no additional data. Where as
the presence of type stem:[T_2] indicated by stem:["idx"(T_2) = 1] implies that
the data is available.
====

[#defn-result-type]
.<<defn-result-type, Result Type>>
====
The *Result* type is a varying data type of stem:[{T_1, T_2}] which is used to
indicate if a certain operation or function was executed successfully (referred
to as "ok" state) or not (referred to as "error" state). stem:[T_1] implies
success, stem:[T_2] implies failure. Both types can either contain additional
data or are defined as empty type otherwise.
====

[#defn-scale-list]
.<<defn-scale-list, Sequence>>
====
The *SCALE codec* for *sequence* stem:[S] such that:

[stem]
++++
S := A_1, ... A_n
++++

where stem:[A_i]’s are values of *the same type* (and the decoder is unable to
infer value of stem:[n] from the context) is defined as:

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_("SC")(S) := "Enc"_("SC")^("Len")(abs(S)) "||" "Enc"_("SC")(A_2) "||" ... "||" "Enc"_("SC")(A_n)
++++

where stem:["Enc"_("SC")^("Len")] is defined in <<defn-sc-len-encoding>>.

In some cases, the length indicator stem:["Enc"_("SC")^("Len")(abs(S))] is omitted
if the length of the sequence is fixed and known by the decoder upfront. Such
cases are explicitly stated by the definition of the corresponding type.
====

[#defn-scale-dictionary]
.<<defn-scale-dictionary, Dictionary>>
====
SCALE codec for *dictionary* or *hashtable* D with key-value pairs stem:[(k_i,
v_i)]s such that:

[stem]
++++
D := {(k_1, v_1), ... (k_n, v_n)}
++++

is defined the SCALE codec of stem:[D] as a sequence of key value pairs (as
tuples):

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_("SC")(D) := "Enc"_("SC")^("Size")(abs(D)) "||" "Enc"_("SC")(k_1, v_1) "||"..."||" "Enc"_("SC")(k_n, v_n)
++++

where stem:["Enc"_("SC")^("Size")] is encoded the same way as
stem:["Enc"_("SC")^("Len")] but argument stem:["Size"] refers to the number of
key-value pairs rather than the length.
====

[#defn-scale-boolean]
.<<defn-scale-boolean, Boolean>>
====
The SCALE codec for a *boolean value* stem:[b] defined as a byte as follows:

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_("SC"): {"False", "True"} -> bbb B_1\
b -> {(0, b="False"),(1, b="True"):}
++++
====

[#defn-scale-string]
.<<defn-scale-string, String>>
====
The SCALE codec for a *string value* is an encoded sequence
(<<defn-scale-list>>) consisting of UTF-8 encoded bytes.
====

[#defn-scale-fixed-length]
.<<defn-scale-fixed-length, Fixed Length>>
====
The SCALE codec, stem:["Enc"_("SC")], for other types such as fixed length
integers not defined here otherwise, is equal to little endian encoding of those
values defined in <<defn-little-endian>>.
====

[#defn-scale-empty]
.<<defn-scale-empty, Empty>>
====
The SCALE codec, stem:["Enc"_("SC")], for an empty type is defined to a byte
array of zero length and depicted as stem:[phi].
====

[#sect-sc-length-and-compact-encoding]
===== Length and Compact Encoding

SCALE Length encoding is used to encode integer numbers of variying sizes prominently in an encoding length of arrays:

[#defn-sc-len-encoding]
.<<defn-sc-len-encoding, Length Encoding>>
====
*SCALE Length encoding*, stem:["Enc"_("SC")^("Len")], also known as a _compact encoding_, of a non-negative number stem:[n] is defined as follows:

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_("SC")^("Len"): bbb N -> bbb B\
n -> b := {(l_1, 0 <= n < 2^6),(i_1 i_2, 2^6 <= n < 2^14),(j_1 j_2 j_3, 2^14 <= n < 2^30),(k_1 k_2 ... k_m, 2^30<=n):}
++++

in where the least significant bits of the first byte of byte array b
are defined as follows:

[stem]
++++
l_1^1 l_1^0 = 00\
i_1^1 i_1^0 = 01\
j_1^1 j_1^0 = 10\
k_1^1 k_1^0 = 11
++++

and the rest of the bits of stem:[b] store the value of stem:[n] in
little-endian format in base-2 as follows:

[stem]
++++
n := {
	(l_1^7 ... l_1^3 l_1^2, n < 2^6),
	(i_2^7 ... i_2^0 i_1^7 .. i_1^2, 2^6 <= n < 2^14),
	(j_4^7 ... j_4^0 j_3^7 ... j_1^7 ... j_1^2, 2^14 <= n < 2^30),
	(k_2 + k_3 2^8 + k_4 2^(2 xx 8)+...+k_m2^((m-2)8),2^30 <= n)
	:}
++++

such that:

[stem]
++++
k_1^7 ... k_1^3 k_1^2 := m-4
++++
====

==== Hex Encoding

Practically, it is more convenient and efficient to store and process data which
is stored in a byte array. On the other hand, the trie keys are broken into
4-bits nibbles. Accordingly, we need a method to encode sequences of 4-bits
nibbles into byte arrays canonically. To this aim, we define
hex encoding function asciimath:["Enc" ("HE")("PK")] as follows:

[#defn-hex-encoding]
.<<defn-hex-encoding, Hex Encoding>>
====
Suppose that stem:["PK" = (k_1, ... k_n)] is a sequence of nibbles, then:

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_("HE")("PK") := {("Nibbles"_4,->, bbb B),("PK" = (k_1, ... k_n),->,{((16k_1+k_2,...,16k_(2i-1)+k_(2i)),n=2i),((k_1,16k_2+k_3,...,16k_(2i)+k_(2i+1)),n = 2i+1):}):}
++++
