== Metadata

The runtime metadata structure contains all the information necessary on how to
interact with the Polkadot runtime. Considering that Polkadot runtimes are
upgradable and therefore any interfaces are subject to change, the metadata
allows developers to structure any extrinsics or storage entries accordingly.

[#sect-rtm-structure]
=== Structure

The Runtime Metadata is a datastructure of the following format:

[stem]
++++
(T, P, E, y)\
T = (r_n, ...,r_(n+m))\
P = (p_n, ...,p_(n+m))\
E = (e_n, ...,e_(n+m))
++++

where

* stem:[r] is a registry containing all type definitions
(<<defn-rtm-registry-entry>>).
