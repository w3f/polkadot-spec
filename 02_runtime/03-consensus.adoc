=== BABE digest messages

The Runtime is required to provide the BABE authority list and
randomness to the host via a consensus message in the header of the
first block of each epoch.

The digest published in Epoch latexmath:[\mathcal{E}_n] is enacted in
latexmath:[\mathcal{E}_{n+1}]. The randomness in this digest is
computed based on the all the VRF outputs up to including Epoch
latexmath:[\mathcal{E}_{n-2}] while the authority set is based on all
transaction included up to Epoch latexmath:[\mathcal{E}_{n-1}].

The computation of the randomeness seed is described in Algorithm
<<algo-epoch-randomness>> which uses the
concept of epoch subchain as described in host specification and the
value latexmath:[d_B], which is the VRF output computed for slot
latexmath:[s_B].
