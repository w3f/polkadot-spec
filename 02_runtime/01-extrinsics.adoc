=== Introduction

An extrinsic is a SCALE encoded array consisting of a version number,
signature, and varying data types indicating the resulting Runtime
function to be called, including the parameters required for that
function to be executed.

=== Preliminaries

An extrinsic , latexmath:[$tx$], is a tuple consisting of the extrinsic
version, latexmath:[$T_v$] (Definition
link:#defn-extrinsic-version[[defn-extrinsic-version]]), and the body of
the extrinsic, latexmath:[$T_b$].

[latexmath]
++++
\[tx := (T_v, T_b)\]
++++

The value of latexmath:[$T_b$] varies for each version. The current
version 4 is described in section link:#sect-version-four[1.3.1].

[#defn-extrinsic-version]#[defn-extrinsic-version]# latexmath:[$T_v$] is
a 8-bit bitfield and defines the extrinsic version. The required format
of an extrinsic body, latexmath:[$T_b$], is dictated by the Runtime.
Older or unsupported version are rejected.

The first bit of latexmath:[$T_v$] indicates whether the transaction is
*signed* (latexmath:[$1$]) or *unsigned* (latexmath:[$0$]). The
remaining 7-bits represent the version number. As an example, for
extrinsic format version 4, an signed extrinsic represents
latexmath:[$T_v$] as `132` while a unsigned extrinsic represents it as
`4`.

=== Extrinsics Body

[[sect-version-four]]
==== Version 4

Version 4 of the Polkadot extrinsic format is defined as follows:

[latexmath]
++++
\[T_b := (A_i, Sig, E, M_i, F_i(m))\]
++++

where each values represents:

* latexmath:[$A_i$]: the 32-byte address of the sender (Definition
link:#defn-extrinsic-address[[defn-extrinsic-address]]).
* latexmath:[$Sig$]: the signature of the sender (Definition
link:#defn-extrinsic-signature[[defn-extrinsic-signature]]).
* latexmath:[$E$]: the extra data for the extrinsic (Definition
link:#defn-extra-data[[defn-extra-data]]).
* latexmath:[$M_i$]: the indicator of the Polkadot module (Definition
link:#defn-module-indicator[[defn-module-indicator]]).
* latexmath:[$F_i(m)$]: the indicator of the function of the Polkadot
module (Definition
link:#defn-function-indicator[[defn-function-indicator]]).

[#defn-extrinsic-address]#[defn-extrinsic-address]# Account Id,
latexmath:[$A_i$], is the 32-byte address of the sender of the extrinsic
as described in the
https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/wiki/External-Address-Format-(SS58)[external
SS58 address format].

[#defn-extrinsic-signature]#[defn-extrinsic-signature]# The signature,
latexmath:[$Sig$], is a varying data type indicating the used signature
type, followed by the signature created by the extrinsic author. The
following types are supported:

[latexmath]
++++
\[Sig :=
        \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{Ed25519, followed by: } (b_0, ...,b_{63}) \\
        1, & \text{Sr25519, followed by: } (b_0, ...,b_{63}) \\
        2, & \text{Ecdsa, followed by: } (b_0, ...,b_{64})
        \end{cases}\]
++++

Signature types vary in sizes, but each individual type is always
fixed-size and therefore does not contain a length prefix. `Ed25519` and
`Sr25519` signatures are 512-bit while `Ecdsa` is 520-bit, where the
last 8 bits are the recovery ID.

The signature is created by signing payload latexmath:[$P$].

[latexmath]
++++
\[\begin{aligned}
        P &:= \begin{cases}
            Raw, & \text{if } |Raw| \leq 256\\
            Blake2(Raw), & \text{if } |Raw| > 256\\
        \end{cases}\\
        Raw &:= (M_i, F_i(m), E, R_v, F_v, H_h(G), H_h(B))\\
        \end{aligned}\]
++++

where each value represents:

* latexmath:[$M_i$]: the module indicator (Definition
link:#defn-module-indicator[[defn-module-indicator]]).
* latexmath:[$F_i(m)$]: the function indicator of the module (Definition
link:#defn-function-indicator[[defn-function-indicator]]).
* latexmath:[$E$]: the extra data (Definition
link:#defn-extra-data[[defn-extra-data]]).
* latexmath:[$R_v$]: a UINT32 containing the specification version of
`14`.
* latexmath:[$F_v$]: a UINT32 containing the format version of `2`.
* latexmath:[$H_h(G)$]: a 32-byte array containing the genesis hash.
* latexmath:[$H_h(B)$]: a 32-byte array containing the hash of the block
which starts the mortality period, as described in Definition
link:#defn-extrinsic-mortality[[defn-extrinsic-mortality]].

[#defn-extra-data]#[defn-extra-data]# Extra data, latexmath:[$E$], is a
tuple containing additional meta data about the extrinsic and the system
it is meant to be executed in.

[latexmath]
++++
\[E := (T_{mor}, N, P_t)\]
++++

where each value represents:

* latexmath:[$T_{mor}$]: contains the SCALE encoded mortality of the
extrinsic (Definition
link:#defn-extrinsic-mortality[[defn-extrinsic-mortality]]).
* latexmath:[$N$]: a compact integer containing the nonce of the sender.
The nonce must be incremented by one for each extrinsic created,
otherwise the Polkadot network will reject the extrinsic.
* latexmath:[$P_t$]: a compact integer containing the transactor pay
including tip.

[#defn-extrinsic-mortality]#[defn-extrinsic-mortality]# Extrinsic
*mortality* is a mechanism which ensures that an extrinsic is only valid
within a certain period of the ongoing Polkadot lifetime. Extrinsics can
also be immortal, as clarified in Section
link:#sect-mortality-encoding[[sect-mortality-encoding]].

The mortality mechanism works with two related values:

* latexmath:[$M_{per}$]: the period of validity in terms of block
numbers from the block hash specified as latexmath:[$H_h(B)$] in the
payload (Definition
link:#defn-extrinsic-signature[[defn-extrinsic-signature]]). The
requirement is latexmath:[$M_{per} \geq 4$] and latexmath:[$M_{per}$]
must be the power of two, such as `32`, `64`, `128`, etc.
* latexmath:[$M_{pha}$]: the phase in the period that this extrinsic’s
lifetime begins. This value is calculated with a formula and validators
can use this value in order to determine which block hash is included in
the payload. The requirement is latexmath:[$M_{pha} < M_{per}$].

In order to tie a transaction’s lifetime to a certain block
(latexmath:[$H_i(B)$]) after it was issued, without wasting precious
space for block hashes, block numbers are divided into regular periods
and the lifetime is instead expressed as a "phase"
(latexmath:[$M_{pha}$]) from these regular boundaries:

[latexmath]
++++
\[M_{pha} = H_i(B)\ mod\ M_{per}\]
++++

latexmath:[$M_{per}$] and latexmath:[$M_{pha}$] are then included in the
extrinsic, as clarified in Definition
link:#defn-extra-data[[defn-extra-data]], in the SCALE encoded form of
latexmath:[$T_{mor}$] (Sect.
link:#sect-mortality-encoding[[sect-mortality-encoding]]). Polkadot
validators can use latexmath:[$M_{pha}$] to figure out the block hash
included in the payload, which will therefore result in a valid
signature if the extrinsic is within the specified period or an invalid
signature if the extrinsic "died".

===== Example

The extrinsic author choses latexmath:[$M_{per} = 256$] at block
`10'000`, resulting with latexmath:[$M_{pha} = 16$]. The extrinsic is
then valid for blocks ranging from `10'000` to `10'256`.

[[sect-mortality-encoding]]
===== Encoding

latexmath:[$T_{mor}$] refers to the SCALE encoded form of type
latexmath:[$M_{per}$] and latexmath:[$M_{pha}$]. latexmath:[$T_{mor}$]
is the size of two bytes if the extrinsic is considered mortal, or
simply one bytes with the value equal to zero if the extrinsic is
considered immortal.

[latexmath]
++++
\[T_{mor} := Enc_{SC}(M_{per}, M_{pha})\]
++++

The SCALE encoded representation of mortality latexmath:[$T_{mor}$]
deviates from most other types, as it’s specialized to be the smallest
possible value, as described in Algorithm
link:#algo-encode-mortality[[algo-encode-mortality]] and
link:#algo-decode-mortality[[algo-decode-mortality]].

// If the extrinsic is immortal, specify // a single byte with the value
equal to zero. latexmath:[$\vcenter{
                \begin{flalign*}
                    \Return & 
                    \begin{cases}
                    0 & if\ extrinsic\ is\ immortal 
                    \end{cases}&

latexmath:[$factor = \textsc{Limit}(M_{per} >> 12,\ 1,\ \phi)$] *Init*
latexmath:[$left = \textsc{Limit}(\textsc{TZ}(M_{per})-1,\ 1,\ 15)$]

                    \textit{Immortal} & if\ T^{b0}_{mor} = 0
                    \end{cases}&
                \end{flalign*}

latexmath:[$factor = \textsc{Limit}(M_{per} >> 12,\ 1,\ \phi)$] *Init*
latexmath:[$M_{pha} = (enc >> 4) * factor$]
latexmath:[$(M_{per}, M_{pha})$]

* latexmath:[$T^{b0}_{mor}$]: the first byte of latexmath:[$T_{mor}$].
* latexmath:[$T^{b1}_{mor}$]: the second byte of latexmath:[$T_{mor}$].
* Limit(latexmath:[$num$], latexmath:[$min$], latexmath:[$max$]):
Ensures that latexmath:[$num$] is between latexmath:[$min$] and
latexmath:[$max$]. If latexmath:[$min$] or latexmath:[$max$] is defined
as latexmath:[$\phi$], then there is no requirement for the specified
minimum/maximum.
* TZ(latexmath:[$num$]): returns the number of trailing zeros in the
binary representation of latexmath:[$num$]. For example, the binary
representation of `40` is `0010 1000`, which has three trailing zeros.
* latexmath:[$>>$]: performs a binary right shift operation.
* latexmath:[$<<$]: performs a binary left shift operation.
* latexmath:[$|$] : performs a bitwise OR operation.

[#defn-module-indicator]#[defn-module-indicator]# latexmath:[$M_i$] is
an indicator for the Runtime to which Polkadot _module_,
latexmath:[$m$], the extrinsic should be forwarded to.

latexmath:[$M_i$] is a varying data type pointing to every module
exposed to the network.

[latexmath]
++++
\[M_i :=
    \begin{cases}
    0, & \text{System} \\
    1, & \text{Utility} \\
    ... & \\
    7, & \text{Balances} \\
    ... &
    \end{cases}\]
++++

[#defn-function-indicator]#[defn-function-indicator]#
latexmath:[$F_i(m)$] is a tuple which contains an indicator,
latexmath:[$m_i$], for the Runtime to which _function_ within the
Polkadot _module_, latexmath:[$m$], the extrinsic should be forwarded
to. This indicator is followed by the concatenated and SCALE encoded
parameters of the corresponding function, latexmath:[$params$].

[latexmath]
++++
\[F_i(m) := (m_i, params)\]
++++

The value of latexmath:[$m_i$] varies for each Polkadot module, since
every module offers different functions. As an example, the `Balances`
module has the following functions:

[latexmath]
++++
\[Balances_i :=
        \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{transfer} \\
        1, & \text{set\_balance} \\
        2 & \text{force\_transfer} \\
        3 & \text{transfer\_keep\_alive} \\
        \end{cases}\]
