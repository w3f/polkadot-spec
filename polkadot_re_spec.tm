  <section|Conventions and Definitions>

  <\definition>
    <strong|Runtime> is the state transition function of the decentralized
    ledger protocol.<verbatim|>
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    <label|def-path-graph>A <strong|path graph> or a <strong|path> of
    <math|n> nodes formally referred to as <strong|<math|P<rsub|n>>>, is a
    tree with two nodes of vertex degree 1 and the other n-2 nodes of vertex
    degree 2. Therefore, <math|P<rsub|n>> can be represented by sequences of
    <math|<around|(|v<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,v<rsub|n>|)>> where
    <math|e<rsub|i>=<around|(|v<rsub|i>,v<rsub|i+1>|)>> for
    <math|1\<leqslant\>i\<leqslant\>n-1> is the edge which connect
    <math|v<rsub|i>> and <math|v<rsub|i+1>>.
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-radix-tree><strong|Radix-r tree> is a variant of \ a trie in
    which:

    <\itemize>
      <item>Every node has at most <math|r> children where <math|r=2<rsup|x>>
      for some <math|x>;

      <item>Each node that is the only child of a parent, which does not
      represent a valid key is merged with its parent.
    </itemize>
  </definition>

  As a result, in a radix tree, any path whose interior vertices all have
  only one child and does not represent a valid key in the data set, is
  compressed into a single edge. This improves space efficiency when the key
  space is sparse.

  <\definition>
    By a <strong|sequences of bytes> or a <strong|byte array>, <math|b>, of
    length <math|n>, we refer to

    <\equation*>
      b\<assign\><around|(|b<rsub|0>,b<rsub|1>,...,b<rsub|n-1>|)>*<text|such
      that >0\<leqslant\>b<rsub|i>\<leqslant\>255
    </equation*>

    We define <math|\<bbb-B\><rsub|n>> to be the <strong|set of all byte
    arrays of length <math|n>>. Furthermore, we define:

    <\equation*>
      \<bbb-B\>\<assign\><big|cup><rsup|\<infty\>><rsub|i=0>\<bbb-B\><rsub|i>
    </equation*>
  </definition>

  <\notation>
    We represent the concatenation of byte arrays
    <math|a\<assign\><around|(|a<rsub|0>,\<ldots\>,a<rsub|n>|)>> and
    <math|b\<assign\><around|(|b<rsub|0>,\<ldots\>,b<rsub|m>|)>> by:

    <\equation*>
      a<around|\|||\|>*b\<assign\><around|(|a<rsub|0>,\<ldots\>,a<rsub|n>,b<rsub|0>,\<ldots\>,b<rsub|m>|)>
    </equation*>
  </notation>

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-bit-rep>For a given byte <math|b> the <strong|bitwise
    representation> of <math|b> is defined as

    <\equation*>
      b\<assign\>b<rsup|7>*\<ldots\>*b<rsup|0>
    </equation*>

    where

    <\equation*>
      b=2<rsup|0>*b<rsup|0>+2<rsup|1>*b<rsup|1>+\<cdots\>+2<rsup|7>*b<rsup|7>

      I=<around*|(|B<rsub|n>\<ldots\>B<rsub|0>|)><rsub|256>
    </equation*>

    in base 256, we refer to a byte array
    <math|B=<around*|(|b<rsub|0>,b<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,b<rsub|n>|)>> such that

    <\equation*>
      b<rsub|i>\<assign\>B<rsub|i>
    </equation*>

    Accordingly, define the function <math|Enc<rsub|LE>>:

    <\equation*>
      <tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|Enc<rsub|LE>:>|<cell|\<bbb-Z\><rsup|+>>|<cell|\<rightarrow\>>|<cell|\<bbb-B\>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|<around*|(|B<rsub|n>\<ldots\>B<rsub|0>|)><rsub|256>>|<cell|\<mapsto\>>|<cell|<around*|(|B<rsub|0,>B<rsub|1>,\<ldots\><rsub|>,B<rsub|n>|)>>>>>>
    </equation*>

    \;
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    By <name|<strong|<verbatim|UINT32>>> we refer to a non-negative integer
    stored in a byte array of length 4 using little-endian encoding format.
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    A <strong|blockchain> <math|C> is a directed path graph. Each node of the
    graph is called <strong|Block> and indicated by <strong|<math|B>>. The
    unique sink of <math|C> is called <strong|Genesis Block>, and the source
    is called the <strong|Head> of C. For any vertex
    <math|<around*|(|B<rsub|1>,B<rsub|2>|)>> where
    <math|B<rsub|1>\<rightarrow\>B<rsub|2>> we say <math|B<rsub|2>> is the
    <strong|parent> of <math|B<rsub|1>> and we indicate it by\ 

    <\equation*>
      B<rsub|2>\<assign\>P<around*|(|B<rsub|1>|)>
    </equation*>
  </definition>

  <subsection|Block Tree>

  In the course of formation of a (distributed) blockchain, it is possible
  that the chain forks into multiple subchains in various block positions. We
  refer to this structure as a <em|block tree:>

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-block-tree>The <strong|block tree> of a blockchain, denoted
    by <math|BT> is the union of all different versions of the blockchain
    observed by all the nodes in the system such as every such block is a
    node in the graph and <math|B<rsub|1>> is connected to <math|B<rsub|2>>
    if <math|B<rsub|1>> is a parent of <math|B<rsub|2>>.
  </definition>

  Definition <reference|defn-chain-subchain> gives the means to highlight
  various branches of the block tree.

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-chain-subchain>Let <math|G> be the root of the block tree and
    <math|B> be a node of it. By <name|<strong|Chain(<math|B>)>,> we refer to
    the path graph from <math|G> to <math|B> in <math|BT>. Conversely, for a
    chain <math|C>=<name|Chain(B)>, we define <strong|the head of <math|C>>
    to be <math|B> formally noted as \ <math|B\<assign\>><name|Head(<math|C>)>.If
    <math|B<rprime|'>> is another node on <name|Chain(<math|B>)>, then by
    <name|SubChain(<math|B<rprime|'>,B>)> we refer to the subgraph of
    <math|><name|Chain(<math|B>)> path graph which contains both <math|B> and
    <math|B<rprime|'>>. <name|Longest-Path(<math|BT>)> returns a path graph
    of <math|BT> which is the longest among all paths in <math|BT>.
    <name|Deepest-Leaf(<math|BT>)> returns the head of
    <name|Longest-Path(<math|BT>)> chain.
  </definition>

  Because every block in the blockchain contains a reference to its parent,
  it is easy to see that the block tree is de facto a tree.

  A block tree naturally imposes partial order relationships on the blocks as
  follows:

  <\definition>
    We say <strong|B is descendant of <math|B<rprime|'>>>, formally noted as
    <strong|<math|B\<gtr\>B<rprime|'>>> if <math|B> is a descendant of
    <math|B<rprime|'>> in the block tree.
  </definition>

  <section|Block Format>

  In Polkadot RE, a block is made of two main parts, namely the
  <with|font-shape|italic|block header> and the <with|font-shape|italic|list
  of extrinsics>. <em|The Extrinsics> represent the generalization of the
  concept of <em|transaction>, containing any set of data that is external to
  the system, and which the underlying chain wishes to validate and keep
  track of.

  <subsection|Block Header><label|block>

  The block header is designed to be minimalistic in order to boost the
  efficiency of the light clients. It is defined formally as follows:

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-block-header>The <strong|header of block B>,
    <strong|<math|Head<around|(|B|)>>> is a 5-tuple containing the following
    elements:

    <\itemize>
      <item><with|font-series|bold|<samp|parent_hash:>> is the 32-byte
      Blake2b hash (see Section <reference|sect-blake2>) of the header of the
      parent of the block indicated henceforth by
      <with|font-series|bold|mode|math|H<rsub|p>>.

      <item><strong|<samp|number:>> formally indicated as
      <strong|<math|H<rsub|i>>> is an integer, which represents the index of
      the current block in the chain. It is equal to the number of the
      ancestor blocks. The genesis block has number 0.

      <item><strong|<samp|state_root:>> formally indicated as
      <strong|<math|H<rsub|r>>> is the root of the Merkle trie, whose leaves
      implement the storage for the system.

      <item><strong|<samp|extrinsics_root:>> is the field which is reserved
      for the runtime to validate the integrity of the extrinsics composing
      the block body. For example, it can hold the root hash of the Merkle
      trie which stores an ordered list of the extrinsics being validated in
      this block. The <samp|extrinsics_root> is set by the runtime and its
      value is opaque to Polkadot RE. This element is formally referred to as
      <strong|<math|H<rsub|e>>>.

      <item><strong|<samp|digest:>> this field is used to store any
      chain-specific auxiliary data, which could help the light clients
      interact with the block without the need of accessing the full storage.
      Polkadot RE does not impose any limitation or specification for this
      field. Essentially, it can be a byte array of any length. This field is
      indicated as <strong|<math|H<rsub|d>>>
    </itemize>
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    <label|def-block-header-hash>The <strong|Block Header Hash of Block
    <math|B>>, <strong|<math|H<rsub|h><around|(|b|)>>>, is the hash of the
    header of block <math|B> encoded by simple codec:\Q

    <\equation*>
      H<rsub|b><around|(|b|)>\<assign\>Blake2b<around|(|Enc<rsub|SC><around|(|Head<around|(|B|)>|)>|)>
    </equation*>
  </definition>

  <subsection|Justified Block Header>

  The Justified Block Header is provided by the consensus engine and
  presented to the Polkadot RE, for the block to be appended to the
  blockchain. It contains the following parts:

  <\itemize>
    <item><strong|<samp|<strong|block_header>>> the complete block header as
    defined in Section <reference|block> and denoted by
    <math|Head<around|(|B|)>>.

    <item><strong|<samp|justification>>: as defined by the consensus
    specification indicated by <math|Just<around|(|B|)>> <todo|link this to
    its definition from consensus>.

    <item><strong|<samp|authority Ids>>: This is the list of the Ids of
    authorities, which have voted for the block to be stored and is formally
    referred to as <math|A<around|(|B|)>>. An authority Id is 32bit.
  </itemize>

  <subsection|Block Format>

  <section|Interactions with the Runtime><label|sect-entries-into-runtime>

  Runtime is the code implementing the logic of the chain. This code is
  decoupled from the Polkadot RE to make the Runtime easily upgradable
  without the need to upgrade the Polkadot RE itself. In this section, we
  describe the details upon which the Polkadot RE is interacting with the
  Runtime.

  <subsection|Loading the Runtime code \ \ >

  Polkadot RE expects to receive the code for the runtime of the chain as a
  compiled WebAssembly (Wasm) Blob. The current runtime is stored in the
  state database under the key represented as a byte array:

  <\equation*>
    b\<assign\><text|3A,63,6F,64,65>
  </equation*>

  which is the byte array of ASCII representation of string \P:code\Q (see
  Section <reference|sect-predef-storage-keys>). For any call to the runtime,
  Polkadot RE makes sure that it has the most updated Runtime as calls to
  runtime have potentially the ability to change the runtime code.

  The initial runtime code of the chain is embedded as an extrinsics into the
  chain initialization JSON file and is submitted to Polkadot RE (see Section
  <reference|sect-genisis-block>).

  Subsequent calls to the runtime have the ability to call the storage API
  (see Section <reference|sect-runtime-api>) to insert a new Wasm blob into
  runtime storage slot to upgrade the runtime.

  <subsection|Code Executor>

  Polkadot RE provides a Wasm Virtual Machine (VM) to run the Runtime. The
  Wasm VM exposes the Polkadot RE API to the Runtime, which, on its turn,
  executes a call to the Runtime entries stored in the Wasm module. This part
  of the Runtime environment is referred to as the <em|<strong|Executor>.>

  Definition <reference|nota-call-into-runtime> introduces the notation for
  calling the runtime entry which is used whenever an algorithm of Polkadot
  RE needs to access the runtime.

  <\notation>
    <label|nota-call-into-runtime> By

    <\equation*>
      <text|<name|Call-Runtime-Entry>><around*|(|<text|<verbatim|Runtime-Entry>>,A<rsub|1>,A<rsub|2>,\<ldots\>,A<rsub|n>|)>
    </equation*>

    we refer to the task using the execuping me cherie when the edits are
    readytor to invoke the <verbatim|Runtime-Entry> while passing an
    <math|A<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,A<rsub|n>> argument to it and using the
    encoding described in Section <reference|sect-send-args-to-runtime>.
  </notation>

  In this section, we specify the general setup for an Executor call into the
  Runtime. In Section <reference|sect-runtime-entries> we specify the
  parameters and the return values of each Runtime entry separately.

  <subsubsection|Access to Runtime API>

  When Polkadot RE calls a Runtime entry it should make sure Runtime has
  access to the all Polkadot Runtime API functions described in Appendix
  <reference|sect-runtime-api>. This can be done for example by loading
  another Wasm module alongside the runtime which imports these functions
  from Polkadot RE as host functions.

  <subsubsection|Sending Arguments to Runtime
  ><label|sect-send-args-to-runtime>

  In general, all data exchanged between Polkadot RE and the Runtime is
  encoded using SCALE codec described in Section
  <reference|sect-scale-codec>. As a Wasm function, all runtime entries have
  the following identical signatures:

  \;

  <cpp|<verbatim|>(func $runtime_entry (param $data i32) (param $len i32)
  (result i64))>

  \;

  In each invocation of a Runtime entry, the arguments which are supposed to
  be sent to the entry, need to be encoded using SCALE codec into a byte
  array <math|B> using the procedure defined in Definition
  <reference|sect-scale-codec>.

  The Executor then needs to retrieve the Wam memory buffer of the Runtime
  Wasm module and extend it to fit the size of the byte array. Afterwards, it
  needs to copy the byte array <math|B> value in the correct offset of the
  extended buffer. Finally, when the Wasm method <verbatim|runtime_entry>,
  corresponding to the entry is invoked, two UINT32 integers are sent to the
  method as arguments. The first argument <verbatim|data> is set to the
  offset where the byte array <math|B> is stored in the Wasm the extended
  shared memory buffer. The second argument <verbatim|len> sets the length of
  the data stored in <math|B>., and the second one is the size of <math|B>.

  <subsubsection|The Return Value from a Runtime
  Entry><label|sect-runtime-return-value>

  The value which is returned from the invocation is an <verbatim|i64>
  integer, representing two consecutive <verbatim|i32> integers in which the
  least significant one indicates the pointer to the offset of the result
  returned by the entry encoded in SCALE codec in the memory buffer. The most
  significant one provides the size of the blob.

  In the case that the runtime entry is returning a boolean value, then the
  SCALEd value returns in the least significant byte and all other bytes are
  set to zero.

  <subsection|Entries into Runtime><label|sect-runtime-entries>

  Polkadot RE assumes that at least the following functions are implemented
  in the Runtime Wasm blob and has been exported as shown in Snippet
  <reference|snippet-runtime-enteries>:

  <section|Network Interactions>

  <subsection|Extrinsics Submission>

  Extrinsic submission is made by sending a <em|Transactions> network
  message. The structure of this message is specified in Section
  <reference|sect-message-transactions>.

  Upon receiving an Transactions message, Polkadot RE decodes the transaction
  and calls <verbatim|validate_trasaction> runtime function defined in
  Section <reference|sect-validate-transaction>, to check the validity of the
  extrinsic. If <verbatim|validate_transaction> considers the submitted
  extrinsics as a valid one, Polkadot RE makes the extrinsics available for
  the consensus engine for inclusion in future blocks.

  <subsection|Network Messages>

  This section specifies various types of messages which Polkadot RE receives
  from the network. Furthermore, it also explains the appropriate responses
  to those messages.

  <subsection|General structure of network messages>

  <\definition>
    A <strong|network message> is a byte array, <strong|<math|M>> of length
    <math|<around*|\<\|\|\>|M|\<\|\|\>>> such that:

    \;

    <\equation*>
      <tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|M<rsub|1>>|<cell|Message Type
      Indicator>>|<row|<cell|M<rsub|2>\<ldots\>M<rsub|<around*|\<\|\|\>|M|\<\|\|\>>>>|<cell|Enc<rsub|SC><around*|(|MessageBody|)>>>>>>
    </equation*>

    \;
  </definition>

  The body of each message consists of different components based on its

  <subsection|Detailed Message Structure><label|sect-message-detail>

  This section disucsses the detailed structure of each network message.

  <subsubsection|Transactions><label|sect-message-transactions>

  \ \ \ \ The transactions Message is represented by <math|M<rsub|T>> and is
  defined as follows:

  <\equation*>
    M<rsub|T>\<assign\>Enc<rsub|SC><around*|(|C<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,C<rsub|n>|)>
  </equation*>

  in which:

  <\equation*>
    C<rsub|i>\<assign\>Enc<rsub|SC><around*|(|E<rsub|i>|)>
  </equation*>

  Where each <math|E<rsub|i>> is a byte array and represents a sepearate
  extrinsic. Polkadot RE is indifferent about the content of an extrinsic and
  treats is as a blob of data.

  <subsection|Block Submission and Validation>

  Block validation is the process, by which the client asserts that a block
  is fit to be added to the blockchain. This means that the block is
  consistent with the world state and transitions from the state of the
  system to a new valid state.

  Blocks can be handed to the Polkadot RE both from the network stack and
  from the consensus engine.

  Both the Runtime and the Polkadot RE need to work together to assure block
  validity. This can be accomplished by Polkadot RE invoking
  <verbatim|execute_block> entry into the runtime as a part of the validation
  process.

  Polkadot RE implements the following procedure to assure the validity of
  the block:

  <\algorithm|<name|Import-and-Validate-Block(<math|B,Just<around|(|B|)>>)>>
    <\algorithmic>
      <\state>
        <name|Verify-Block-Justification><math|<around|(|B,Just<around|(|B|)>|)>>
      </state>

      <\state>
        <\IF>
          <math|B> <strong|is> Finalized <strong|and> <math|P<around*|(|B|)>>
          <strong|is not> Finalized
        </IF>
      </state>

      <\state>
        <name|Mark-as-Final><math|<around*|(|P<around*|(|B|)>|)>><END>
      </state>

      <\state>
        Verify <math|H<rsub|p<around|(|B|)>>\<in\>Blockchain>
      </state>

      <\state>
        State-Changes = Runtime<name|<math|<around|(|B|)>>>
      </state>

      <\state>
        <name|Update-World-State>(State-Changes)
      </state>
    </algorithmic>
  </algorithm>

  For the definition of the finality and the finalized block see Section
  <reference|sect-finality>.

  <section|State Storage and the Storage Trie>

  For storing the state of the system, Polkadot RE implements a hash table
  storage where the keys are used to access each data entry. There is no
  assumption either on the size of the key nor on the size of the data stored
  under them, besides the fact that they are byte arrays with specific upper
  limits on their length. The limit is imposed by the encoding algorithms to
  store the key and the value in the storage trie.

  <subsection|Accessing The System Storage >

  Polkadot RE implements various functions to facilitate access to the system
  storage for the runtime. Section <reference|sect-runtime-api> lists all of
  those functions. Here we formalize the access to the storage when it is
  being directly accessed by Polkadot RE (in contrast to Polkadot runtime).

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-stored-value>The <strong|StoredValue> function retrieves the
    value stored under a specific key in the state storage and is formally
    defined as :

    <\equation*>
      <tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|StoredValue:>|<cell|\<cal-K\>\<rightarrow\>\<cal-V\>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|k\<mapsto\><around*|{|<tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|v>|<cell|<text|if
      (k,v) exists in state storage>>>|<row|<cell|\<phi\>>|<cell|otherwise>>>>>|\<nobracket\>>>>>>>
    </equation*>

    where <math|\<cal-K\>\<subset\>\<bbb-B\>> and
    <math|\<cal-V\>\<subset\>\<bbb-B\>> are respectively the set of all keys
    and values stored in the state storage.

    \;
  </definition>

  <subsection|The General Tree Structure>

  In order to ensure the integrity of the state of the system, the stored
  data needs to be re-arranged and hashed in a <em|modified Merkle Patricia
  Tree>, which hereafter we refer to as the <em|<strong|Trie>>. This
  rearrangment is necessary to be able to compute the Merkle hash of the
  whole or part of the state storage, consistently and efficiently at any
  given time.

  The Trie is used to compute the <em|state root>, <math|H<rsub|r>>, (see
  Definition <reference|def-block-header>), whose purpose is to authenticate
  the validity of the state database. Thus, Polkadot RE follows a rigorous
  encoding algorithm to compute the values stored in the trie nodes to ensure
  that the computed Merkle hash, <math|H<rsub|r>>, matches across the
  Polkadot RE implementations.

  The Trie is a <em|radix-16> tree as defined in Definition
  <reference|defn-radix-tree>. Each key value identifies a unique node in the
  tree. However, a node in a tree might or might not be associated with a key
  in the storage.\ 

  When traversing the Trie to a specific node, its key can be reconstructed
  by concatenating the subsequences of the key which are stored either
  explicitly in the nodes on the path or implicitly in their position as a
  child of their parent.

  To identify the node corresponding to a key value, <math|k>, first we need
  to encode <math|k> in a consistent with the Trie structure way. Because
  each node in the trie has at most 16 children, we represent the key as a
  sequence of 4-bit nibbles:

  <\definition>
    For the purpose of labeling the branches of the Trie, the key <math|k> is
    encoded to <math|k<rsub|enc>> using KeyEncode functions:

    <\equation>
      k<rsub|enc>\<assign\><around|(|k<rsub|enc<rsub|1>>,\<ldots\>,k<rsub|enc<rsub|2*n>>|)>\<assign\>KeyEncode<around|(|k|)><label|key-encode-in-trie>
    </equation>

    such that:

    <\equation*>
      KeyEncode<around|(|k|)>:<around*|{|<tabular*|<tformat|<cwith|1|-1|1|1|cell-halign|l>|<cwith|1|-1|1|1|cell-lborder|0ln>|<cwith|1|-1|2|2|cell-halign|l>|<cwith|1|-1|3|3|cell-halign|l>|<cwith|1|-1|3|3|cell-rborder|0ln>|<table|<row|<cell|\<bbb-B\><rsup|\<nosymbol\>>>|<cell|\<rightarrow\>>|<cell|Nibbles<rsup|4>>>|<row|<cell|k\<assign\><around|(|b<rsub|1>,\<ldots\>,b<rsub|n>|)>\<assign\>>|<cell|\<mapsto\>>|<cell|<around|(|b<rsup|1><rsub|1>,b<rsup|2><rsub|1>,b<rsub|2><rsup|1>,b<rsup|2><rsub|2>,\<ldots\>,b<rsup|1><rsub|n>,b<rsup|2><rsub|n>|)>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|>|<cell|\<assign\><around|(|k<rsub|enc<rsub|1>>,\<ldots\>,k<rsub|enc<rsub|2*n>>|)>>>>>>|\<nobracket\>>
    </equation*>

    where <math|Nibble<rsup|4>> is the set of all nibbles of 4-bit arrays and
    <math|b<rsup|1><rsub|i>> and <math|b<rsup|2><rsub|i>> are 4-bit nibbles,
    which are the big endian representations of <math|b<rsub|i>>:

    <\equation*>
      <around|(|b<rsup|1><rsub|i>,b<rsup|2><rsub|i>|)>\<assign\><around|(|b<rsub|i>/16,b<rsub|i>mod
      16|)>
    </equation*>

    , where mod is the remainder and / is the integer division operators.
  </definition>

  By looking at <math|k<rsub|enc>> as a sequence of nibbles, one can walk the
  radix tree to reach the node identifying the storage value of <math|k>.

  <subsection|The Trie structure>

  In this subsection, we specify the structure of the nodes in the Trie as
  well as the Trie structure:

  <\notation>
    We refer to the <strong|set of the nodes of Polkadot state trie> by
    <math|\<cal-N\>.> By <math|N\<in\>\<cal-N\>> to refer to an individual
    node in the trie.
  </notation>

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-nodetype>The State Trie is a radix-16 tree. Each Node in the
    Trie is identified with a unique key <math|k<rsub|N>> such that:

    <\itemize-minus>
      <item><math|k<rsub|N>> is the shared prefix of the key of all the
      descendants of <math|N> in the Trie.
    </itemize-minus>

    \ and, at least one of the following statements holds:

    <\itemize-minus>
      <item><math|<around*|(|k<rsub|N>,v|)>> corresponds to an existing entry
      in the State Storage.

      <item>N has more than one child.
    </itemize-minus>

    Conversely, if <math|<around*|(|k,v|)>> is an entry in the State Trie
    then there is a node <math|N\<in\>\<cal-N\>> such that
    <math|k<rsub|N>>=k.
  </definition>

  <\notation>
    A <strong|branch> node is a node which has one child or more. A branch
    node can have at most 16 children. A <strong|leaf> node is a childless
    node. Accordingly:

    <\equation*>
      <tabular*|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|\<cal-N\><rsub|b>\<assign\><around*|{|N\<in\>\<cal-N\>\|N
      <text|is a branch node>|}>>>|<row|<cell|\<cal-N\><rsub|l>\<assign\><around*|{|N\<in\>\<cal-N\>\|N
      <text|is a leaf node>|}>>>>>>
    </equation*>
  </notation>

  For each Node, part of <math|k<rsub|N>> is built while the trie is
  traversed from root to <math|N> part of <math|k<rsub|N>> is stored in
  <math|N> as formalized in Definition <reference|defn-node-key>.

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-node-key>For any <math|N\<in\>\<cal-N\>>, its key
    <math|k<rsub|N>> is divided into an <strong|aggregated prefix key>,
    <strong|<math|pk<rsub|N><rsup|Agr>>>, aggregated by Algorithm
    <reference|algo-aggregate-key> and a <strong|partial key>,
    <strong|<math|pk<rsub|N>>> of length <math|0\<leqslant\>l<rsub|pk<rsub|N>>\<leqslant\>65535>
    such that:

    <\equation*>
      pk<rsub|N>\<assign\><around|(|k<rsub|enc<rsub|i>>,\<ldots\>,k<rsub|enc<rsub|i+l<rsub|pk<rsub|N>>>>|)>
    </equation*>

    where <math|pk<rsub|N>> is a suffix subsequence of <math|k<rsub|N>>; and
    we have:

    <\equation*>
      KeyEncode<around|(|k<rsub|N>|)>=pk<rsub|N><rsup|Agr>\|pk<rsub|N>=<around|(|k<rsub|enc<rsub|1>>,\<ldots\>,k<rsub|enc<rsub|i-1>>,k<rsub|enc<rsub|i>>,k<rsub|enc<rsub|i+l<rsub|pk<rsub|N>>>>|)>
    </equation*>
  </definition>

  Part of <math|pk<rsub|N><rsup|Agr>> is explicitly stored in <math|N>'s
  ancestors. Additionally, for each ancestor, a single nibble is implicitly
  derived while traversing from the ancestor to its child included in the
  traversal path using the <math|Index<rsub|N>> function defined in
  Definition <reference|defn-index-function>.

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-index-function>For <math|N\<in\>\<cal-N\><rsub|b>> and
    <math|N<rsub|c>> child of N, we define <strong|<math|Index<rsub|N>>>
    function as:

    <\equation*>
      <tabular*|<tformat|<cwith|1|1|2|2|cell-halign|l>|<table|<row|<cell|Index<rsub|N>:>|<cell|<around*|{|N<rsub|c>\<in\>\<cal-N\>\|N<rsub|c>
      <text|is a child of N>|}>\<rightarrow\>Nibbles<rsup|4><rsub|1>>>|<row|<cell|>|<cell|N<rsub|c>\<mapsto\>i<rsub|>>>>>>
    </equation*>

    such that

    <\equation*>
      k<rsub|N<rsub|c>>=k<rsub|N><around*|\|||\|>i<around*|\|||\|>pk<rsub|N<rsub|c>>
    </equation*>
  </definition>

  Assuming that <math|P<rsub|N>> is the path (see Definition
  <reference|def-path-graph>) from the Trie root to node <math|N>, Algorithm
  <reference|algo-aggregate-key> rigorously demonstrates how to build
  <math|pk<rsup|Agr><rsub|N>> while traversing <math|P<rsub|N>>.

  <\algorithm>

  <subsection|The Merkle proof><label|sect-merkl-proof>

  To prove the consistency of the state storage across the network and its
  modifications both efficiently and effectively, the Trie implements a
  Merkle tree structure. The hash value corresponding to each node needs to
  be computed rigorously to make the inter-implementation data integrity
  possible.

  The Merkle value of each node should depend on the Merkle value of all its
  children as well as on its corresponding data in the state storage. This
  recursive dependancy is encompassed into the subvalue part of the node
  value which recursively depends on the Merkle value of its children.

  We use the auxilary function introduced in Definition
  <reference|defn-children-bitmap> to encode and decode information stored in
  a branch node.

  </definition>

  <subsection|Processing Extrinsics>

  The block body consists of a set of extrinsics. Nonetheless, Polkadot RE
  does not specify or limit the internals of each extrinsics. From Polkadot
  RE point of view, each extrinsics is a SCALE encoded in byte arrays (see
  Definition <reference|defn-scale-byte-array>).

  The extrinsics are submitted to the node through the <em|transactions>
  network message specified in Section <reference|sect-message-transactions>.
  Upon receiving a transactions message, Polkadot RE separates the submitted
  transactions message into individual extrinsics and runs Algorithm
  <reference|algo-validate-transactions> to validate them and store them to
  include them into future blocks.

  <section|Consensus Engine>

  Consensus in Polkadot RE is achieved during the execution of two different
  procedures. The first procedure is block production and the second is
  finality. Polkadot RE must run these procedures, if and only if it is
  running on a validator node.

  <subsection|Block Production>

  Polkadot RE uses BABE protocol <cite|w3f_research_group_blind_2019> for
  block production designed based on Ouroboros praos
  <cite|david_ouroboros_2018>. BABE execution happens in sequential
  non-overlapping phases known as an <strong|<em|epoch>>. Each epoch on its
  turn is divided into a predefined number of slots. All slots in each epoch
  are sequentially indexed starting from 0. At the beginning of each epoch,
  the BABE node needs to run Algorithm <reference|algo-block-production-lottery>
  to find out in which slots it should produce a block and gossip to the
  other block producers. In turn, the block producer node should keep a copy
  of the block tree and grow it as it receives valid blocks from other block
  producers. A block producer prunes the tree in parallel using Algorithm
  <reference|algo-block-tree-prunning>.

  <subsubsection|Preliminaries>

  <\definition>
    A <strong|block producer>, noted by <math|\<cal-P\><rsub|j>>, is a node
    running Polkadot RE which is authorized to keep a transaction queue and
    which gets a turn in producing blocks.
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    <strong|Block authring session key pair
    <math|<around*|(|sk<rsup|s><rsub|j>,pk<rsup|s><rsub|j>|)>>> is an SR25519
    key pair which the block producer <math|\<cal-P\><rsub|j>> signs by their
    account key (see Definition <reference|defn-account-key>) and is used to
    sign the produced block as well as to compute its lottery values in
    Algorithm <reference|algo-block-production-lottery>.\ 
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    A block production <strong|epoch>, formally referred to as
    <math|\<cal-E\>> is a period with pre-known starting time and fixed
    length during which the set of block producers stays constant. Epochs are
    indexed sequentially, and we refer to the <math|n<rsup|th>> epoch since
    genesis by <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|n>>. Each epoch is divided into
    <math|>equal length periods known as block production <strong|slots>,
    sequentially indexed in each epoch. Each slot is awarded to a subset of
    block producers during which they are allowed to generate a block.
  </definition>

  <\notation>
    <label|note-slot>We refer to the number of slots in epoch
    <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|n>> by <math|sc<rsub|n>>. <math|sc<rsub|n>> is set
    to the result of calling runtime entry \ <verbatim|BabeApi_slot_duration>
    at the \Pbeginning of each epoch. For a given block <math|B>, we use the
    notation <strong|<math|s<rsub|B>>> to refer to the slot during which
    <math|B> has been produced. Conversely, for slot <math|s>,
    <math|\<cal-B\><rsub|s>> is the set of Blocks generated at slot <math|s>.
  </notation>

  Definition <reference|defn-epoch-subchain> provides an iterator over the
  blocks produced during an specific epoch.

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-epoch-subchain> By <name|SubChain(<math|\<cal-E\><rsub|n>>)>
    for epoch <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|n>>, we refer to the path graph of
    <math|BT> which contains all the blocks generated during the slots of
    epoch <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|n>>. When there is more than one block
    generated at a slot, we choose the one which is also on
    <name|Longest-Branch(<math|BT>)>.
  </definition>

  <subsubsection|Block Production Lottery>

  <\definition>
    <strong|Winning threshold> denoted by <strong|<math|\<tau\>>> is the
    threshold which is used alongside with the result of Algorirthm
    <reference|algo-block-production-lottery> to decide if a block producer
    is the winner of a specific slot. <math|\<tau\>> is set to result of call
    into <code*|BabeApi_slot_winning_threshold> runtime entry.
  </definition>

  \ A block producer aiming to produce a block during
  <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|n>> should run Algorithm
  <reference|algo-block-production-lottery> to identify the slots it is
  awarded. These are the slots during which the block producer is allowed to
  build a block. The <math|sk> is the block producer lottery secret key and
  <math|n> is the index of epoch for whose slots the block producer is
  running the lottery.

          A
        </RETURN>
      </state>
    </algorithmic>
  </algorithm>

  For any slot <math|i> in epoch <math|n> where <math|d\<less\>\<tau\>>, the
  block producer is required to produce a block. For the definitions of
  <name|Epoch-Randomness<math|>> and <em|<name|VRF>> functions, see Algorithm
  <reference|algo-epoch-randomness> and Section <reference|sect-vrf>
  respectively.

  <subsubsection|Slot number calculation>

  It is essential for a block producer to calculate and validate the slot
  number at a certain point in time. Slots are dividing the time continuum in
  an overlapping interval. At a given time, the block producer should be able
  to determine the set of slots which can be associated to a valid block
  generated at that time. We formalize the notion of validity in the
  following definitions:

  <\definition>
    <label|slot-time-cal-tail>The <strong|slot tail>, formally referred to by
    <math|SlTl> represents the number of on-chain blocks that are used to
    estimate the slot time of a given slot. This number is set to be 1200.
  </definition>

  Algorithm <reference|algo-slot-time> determines the slot time for a future
  slot based on the <em|block arrival time> associated with blocks in the
  slot tail defined in Definition <reference|defn-block-time>.

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-block-time>The <strong|block arrival time> of block <math|B>
    for node <math|j> formally represented by
    <strong|<math|T<rsup|j><rsub|B>>> is the local time of node <math|j> when
    node <math|j> has received the block <math|B> for the first time. If the
    node <math|j> itself is the producer of <math|B>,
    <math|T<rsub|B><rsup|j>> is set equal to the time that the block is
    produced. The index <math|j> in <math|T<rsup|j><rsub|B>> notation may be
    dropped when there is no ambiguity about the underlying node.
  </definition>

  In addition to the arrival time of block <math|B>, the block producer also
  needs to know how many slots have passed since the arrival of <math|B>.
  This value is formalized in Definition <reference|defn-slot-offset>.

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-slot-offset>Let <math|s<rsub|i>> and <math|s<rsub|j>> be two
    slots belonging to epochs <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|k>> and
    <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|l>>. By <name|Slot-Offset><math|<around*|(|s<rsub|i>,s<rsub|j>|)>>
    we refer to the function whose value is equal to the number of slots
    between <math|s<rsub|i>> and <math|s<rsub|j>> (counting <math|s<rsub|j>>)
    on time continuum. As such, we have <name|Slot-Offset><math|<around*|(|s<rsub|i>,s<rsub|i>|)>=0>.

  <subsubsection|Block Production>

  At each epoch, each block producer should run Algorithm
  <reference|algo-block-production> to produce blocks during the slots it has
  been awarded during that epoch. The produced blocks need to be broadcasted
  alongside with the <em|babe header> defined in Definition
  <reference|defn-babe-header>.

  <\definition>
    The <label|defn-babe-header><strong|Babe Header> of block B, referred to
    formally by <strong|<math|H<rsub|Babe><around*|(|B|)>>> is a tuple that
    consists of the following components:

    <\equation*>

  <subsubsection|Epoch Randomness>

  At the end of epoch <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|n>>, each block producer is able

  block production lottery in epoch <math|\<cal-E\><rsub|n+2>>. The
  computation of the seed is described in Algorithm
  <reference|algo-epoch-randomness> which uses the concept of epoch subchain

  <subsection|Finality><label|sect-finality>

  Polkadot RE uses GRANDPA Finality protocol
  <cite|alistair_stewart_grandpa:_2019> to finalize blocks. Finality is
  obtained by consecutive rounds of voting by validator nodes. Validators
  execute GRANDPA finality process in parallel to Block Production as an
  independent service. In this section, we describe the different functions
  that GRANDPA service is supposed to perform to successfully participate in
  the block finalization process.

  <subsubsection|Preliminaries>

  <\definition>
    A <strong|GRANDPA Voter>, <math|v>, is represented by a key pair
    <math|<around|(|k<rsup|pr><rsub|v>,v<rsub|id>|)>> where
    <math|k<rsub|v><rsup|pr>> represents its private key which is an
    <math|ED25519> private key, is a node running GRANDPA protocol, and
    broadcasts votes to finalize blocks in a Polkadot RE - based chain. The
    <strong|set of all GRANDPA voters> is indicated by <math|\<bbb-V\>>. For
    a given block B, we have4

    <\equation*>
      \<bbb-V\><rsub|B>=<verbatim|authorities><around*|(|B|)>
    </equation*>

    where <math|<math-tt|authorities>> is the entry into runtime described in
    Section <reference|sect-runtime-api-auth>.
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    <strong|GRANDPA state>, <math|GS>, is defined as

    <\equation*>
      GS\<assign\><around|{|\<bbb-V\>,id<rsub|\<bbb-V\>>,r|}>
    </equation*>

    where:

    <math|\<bbb-V\>>: is the set of voters.

    <strong|<math|\<bbb-V\><rsub|id>>>: is an incremental counter tracking
    <verbatim|>membership, which changes in V.

    <strong|r>: is the votin<verbatim|>g round number.
  </definition>

  Now we need to define how Polkadot RE counts the number of votes for block
  <math|B>. First a vote is defined as:

  <\definition>
    <label|def-vote>A <strong|GRANDPA vote >or simply a vote for block
    <math|B> is an ordered pair defined as

    <\equation*>
      V<rsub|\<nosymbol\>><around|(|B|)>\<assign\><around|(|H<rsub|h><around|(|B|)>,H<rsub|i><around|(|B|)>|)>
    </equation*>

    where <math|H<rsub|h><around|(|B|)>> and <math|H<rsub|i><around|(|B|)>>
    are the block hash and the block number defined in Definitions
    <reference|def-block-header> and <reference|def-block-header-hash>
    respectively.
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    Voters engage in a maximum of two sub-rounds of voting for each round
    <math|r>. The first sub-round is called <strong|pre-vote> and<verbatim|>
    the second sub-round is called <strong|pre-commit>.

    By <strong|<math|V<rsub|v><rsup|r,pv>>> and
    <strong|<math|V<rsub|v><rsup|r,pc>>> we refer to the vote cast by voter
    <math|v> in round <math|r> (for block <math|B>) during the pre-vote and
    the pre-commit sub-round respectively.
  </definition>

  The GRANDPA protocol dictates how an honest voter should vote in each
  sub-round, which is described in Algorithm <reference|alg-grandpa-round>.
  After defining what constitues a vote in GRANDPA, we define how GRANDPA
  counts votes.

  <\definition>
    Voter <math|v> <strong|equivocates> if they broadcast two or more valid
    votes to blocks not residing on the same branch of the block tree during
    one voting sub-round. In such a situation, we say that <math|v> is an
    <strong|equivocator> and any vote <math|V<rsub|v><rsup|r,stage><around*|(|B|)>>
    cast by <math|v> in that round is an <strong|equivocatory vote> and

    <\equation*>
      \<cal-E\><rsup|r,stage>
    </equation*>

    \ represents the set of all equivocators voters in sub-round
    \P<math|stage>\Q of round <math|r>. When we want to refer to the number
    of<verbatim|> equivocators whose equivocation has been observed by voter
    <math|v> we refer to it by:

    <\equation*>
      \<cal-E\><rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around*|(|v|)>>
    </equation*>

    \ 
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    A vote <math|V<rsub|v><rsup|r,stage>=V<around|(|B|)>> is <strong|invalid>
    if

    <\itemize>
      <\itemize-dot>
        <item><math|H<around|(|B|)>> does not correspond to a valid block;

        <item><math|B> is not an (eventual) descendant of a previously
        finalized block;

        <item><math|M<rsup|r,stage><rsub|v>> does not bear a valid signature;

        <item><math|id<rsub|\<bbb-V\>>> does not match the current
        <math|\<bbb-V\>>;

        <item>If <math|V<rsub|v><rsup|r,stage>> is an equivocatory vote.
      </itemize-dot>
    </itemize>
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    For validator v, <strong|the set of observed direct votes for Block
    <math|B> in round <math|r>>, formally denoted by
    <math|VD<rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><rsup|\<nosymbol\>><rsub|\<nosymbol\>><around|(|B|)>>
    is equal to the union of:

    <\itemize-dot>
      <item>set of valid votes <math|V<rsup|r,stage><rsub|v<rsub|i>>> cast in
      round <math|r> and received by v such that
      <math|V<rsup|r,stage><rsub|v<rsub|i>>=V<around|(|B|)>>.
    </itemize-dot>
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    We refer to <strong|the set of total votes observed by voter <math|v> in
    sub-round \P<math|stage>\Q of round <math|r>> by
    <strong|<math|V<rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><rsup|\<nosymbol\>><rsub|\<nosymbol\>>>>.

    The <strong|set of all observed votes by <math|v> in the sub-round stage
    of round <math|r> for block <math|B>>,
    <strong|<math|V<rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><around|(|B|)>>> is
    equal to all of the observed direct votes casted for block <math|B> and
    all of the <math|B>'s descendents defined formally as:

    <\equation*>
      V<rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><around|(|B|)>\<assign\><big|cup><rsub|v<rsub|i>\<in\>\<bbb-V\>,B\<geqslant\>B<rprime|'>>VD<rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><around|(|B<rprime|'>|)><rsub|\<nosymbol\>><rsup|\<nosymbol\>><rsub|\<nosymbol\>>
    </equation*>

    The <strong|total number of observed votes for Block <math|B> in round
    <math|r>> is defined to be the size of that set plus the total number of
    equivocators voters:

    <\equation*>
      #V<rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><around|(|B|)>=<around|\||V<rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><around|(|B|)>|\|>+<around*|\||\<cal-E\><rsup|r,stage><rsub|obs<around*|(|v|)>>|\|>
    </equation*>
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    The current <strong|pre-voted> block <math|B<rsup|r,pv><rsub|v>> is the
    block with

    <\equation*>
      H<rsub|n><around|(|B<rsup|r,pv><rsub|v>|)>=Max<around|(|<around|\<nobracket\>|H<rsub|n><around|(|B|)>|\|>*\<forall\>B:#V<rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><rsup|r,pv><around|(|B|)>\<geqslant\>2/3<around|\||\<bbb-V\>|\|>|)>
    </equation*>
  </definition>

  Note that for genesis block <math|Genesis> we always have
  <math|#V<rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>><rsup|r,pv><around|(|B|)>=<around*|\||\<bbb-V\>|\|>>.

  \;

  Finally, we define when a voter <math|v> see a round as completable, that
  is when they are confident that <math|B<rsub|v><rsup|r,pv>> is an upper
  bound for what is going to be finalised in this round. \ 

  <\definition>
    <label|defn-grandpa-completable>We say that round <math|r> is
    <strong|completable> if <math|<around|\||V<rsup|r,pc><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>>|\|>+\<cal-E\><rsup|r,pc><rsub|obs<around*|(|v|)>>\<gtr\><frac|2|3>\<bbb-V\>>
    and for all <math|B<rprime|'>\<gtr\>B<rsub|v><rsup|r,pv>>:

    <\equation*>
      <tabular|<tformat|<cwith|1|1|1|1|cell-valign|b>|<table|<row|<cell|<around|\||V<rsup|r,pc><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)>>|\|>-\<cal-E\><rsup|r,pc><rsub|obs<around*|(|v|)>>-<around|\||V<rsup|r,pc><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)><rsub|\<nosymbol\>>><around|(|B<rprime|'>|)>|\|>\<gtr\><frac|2|3><around|\||\<bbb-V\>|\|>>>>>>
    </equation*>
  </definition>

  Note that in practice we only need to check the inequality for those
  <math|B<rprime|'>\<gtr\>B<rsub|v><rsup|r,pv>> where
  <math|<around|\||V<rsup|r,pc><rsub|obs<around|(|v|)><rsub|\<nosymbol\>>><around|(|B<rprime|'>|)>|\|>\<gtr\>0>.\ 

  \;

  <subsubsection|Voting Messages Specification>

  Voting is done by means of broadcasting voting messages to the network.
  Validators inform their peers about the block finalized in round <math|r>
  by broadcasting a finalization message (see Algorithm
  <reference|alg-grandpa-round> for more details). These messages are
  specified in this section.

  <\definition>
    A vote casted by voter <math|v> should be broadcasted as a
    <strong|message <math|M<rsup|r,stage><rsub|v>>> to the network by voter
    <math|v> with the following structure:

    <\equation*>
      M<rsup|r,stage><rsub|v>\<assign\>Enc<rsub|SC><around|(|r,id<rsub|\<bbb-V\>>,Enc<rsub|SC><around|(|stage,V<rsub|v><rsup|r,stage>|\<nobracket\>>,Sig<rsub|ED25519><around|(|Enc<rsub|SC><around|(|stage,V<rsub|v><rsup|r,stage>|\<nobracket\>>,r,V<rsub|id>|)>,v<rsub|id>|)>
    </equation*>

    Where:

    <\center>
      <tabular*|<tformat|<cwith|1|-1|1|1|cell-halign|r>|<cwith|1|-1|1|1|cell-lborder|0ln>|<cwith|1|-1|2|2|cell-halign|l>|<cwith|1|-1|3|3|cell-halign|l>|<cwith|1|-1|3|3|cell-rborder|0ln>|<cwith|1|-1|1|-1|cell-valign|c>|<table|<row|<cell|r:>|<cell|round

      pre-commit sub-round>|<cell|>>>>>
    </center>

    \;
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    <label|def-grandpa-justification>The <strong|justification for block B in
    round <math|r>> of GRANDPA protocol defined
    <math|J<rsup|r><around*|(|B|)>> is a vector of pairs of the type:

    <\equation*>
      <around*|(|V<around*|(|B<rprime|'>|)>,<around*|(|Sign<rsup|r,pc><rsub|v<rsub|i>><around*|(|B<rprime|'>|)>,v<rsub|id>|)>|)>
    </equation*>

    in which either

    <\equation*>
      B<rprime|'>\<gtr\>B
    </equation*>

    or <math|V<rsup|r,pc><rsub|v<rsub|i>><around*|(|B<rprime|'>|)>> is an
    equivocatory vote.

    In all cases, <math|Sign<rsup|r,pc><rsub|v<rsub|i>><around*|(|B<rprime|'>|)>>
    is the signature of voter <math|v<rsub|i>> broadcasted during the
    pre-commit sub-round of round r.
  </definition>

  <\definition>
    <strong|<math|GRANDPA> finalizing message for block <math|B> in round
    <math|r>> represented as <strong|<math|M<rsub|v><rsup|r,Fin>>(B)> is a
    message broadcasted by voter <math|v> to the network indicating that
    voter <math|v> has finalized block <math|B> in round <math|r>. It has the
    following structure:

    <\equation*>
      M<rsup|r,Fin><rsub|v><around*|(|B|)>\<assign\>Enc<rsub|SC><around|(|r,V<around*|(|B|)>,J<rsup|r><around*|(|B|)>|)>
    </equation*>

    in which <math|J<rsup|r><around*|(|B|)>> in the justification defined in
    Definition <reference|def-grandpa-justification>.
  </definition>

  <subsubsection|Initiating the GRANDPA State>

  A validator needs to initiate its state and sync it with other validators,
  to be able to participate coherently in the voting process. In particular,
  considering that voting is happening in different rounds and each round of
  voting is assigned a unique sequential round number <math|r<rsub|v>>, it
  needs to determine and set its round counter <math|r> in accordance with
  the current voting round <math|r<rsub|n>>, which is currently undergoing in
  the network.

  As instructed in Algorithm <reference|alg-join-leave-grandpa>, whenever the
  membership of GRANDPA voters changes, <math|r> is set to 0 and
  <math|V<rsub|id>> needs to be incremented.

  SHA-3 competition.

  Polkadot is using Blake2b variant which is optimized for 64bit platforms.
  Unless otherwise specified, Blake2b hash function with 256bit output is
  used whenever Blake2b is invoked in this document. The detailed
