## -sec-num- Introduction {#id-introduction-2}

The Polkadot network is decentralized and does not rely on any central authority or entity to achieve its fullest potential of provided functionality. The networking protocol is based on a family of open protocols, including protocol implemented *libp2p*, e.g., the distributed Kademlia hash table, which is used for peer discovery.

This chapter walks through the behavior of the networking implementation of the Polkadot Host and defines the network messages. The implementation details of the *libp2p* protocols used are specified in external sources as described in [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-networking-external-docs)

## -sec-num- External Documentation {#sect-networking-external-docs}

Complete specification of the Polkadot networking protocol relies on the following external protocols:

- [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/specs) - *libp2p* is a modular peer-to-peer networking stack composed of many modules and different parts. includes the multiplexing protocols and

- [libp2p addressing](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/addressing/) - The Polkadot Host uses the *libp2p* addressing system to identify and connect to peers.

- [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) - *Kademlia* is a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer networks. The Polkadot Host uses Kademlia for peer discovery.

- [Noise](https://noiseprotocol.org/) - The *Noise* protocol is a framework for building cryptographic protocols. The Polkadot Host uses Noise to establish the encryption layer to remote peers.

- [yamux](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/stream-multiplexing/#yamux) - *yamux* is a multiplexing protocol developed by HashiCorp. It is the de-facto standard for the Polkadot Host. [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-protocols-substreams) describes the subprotocol in more detail.

- [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/proto3-spec) - Protocol Buffers is a language-neutral, platform-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data and is developed by Google. The Polkadot Host uses Protocol Buffers to serialize specific messages, as clarified in [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-network-messages).

## -sec-num- Node Identities {#id-node-identities}

Like any other distributed system, each Polkadot Host node has a unique global identifier. This identifier, called `PeerId`, serves as a singular reference to a particular node within the overall network.
In Polkadot, each node is required to maintain its own pair of ED25519 cryptographic keys from which the `PeerId` [is derived](https://pl-launchpad.io/curriculum/libp2p/connections/#peer-identity).  

The Polkadot nodeâ€™s `PeerId` is structured based on the [libp2p specification](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/) but does not fully conform to the specification. In particular, it does not support [CID](https://github.com/multiformats/cid) and the only supported key type is ED25519. The `PeerId` is built by hashing the [encoded public key](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/peer-ids/peer-ids.md#keys) with [multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash) and represented as follows:

###### Definition -def-num- PeerId {#defn-peer-id}
:::definition

The byte representation of the PeerId is always of the following bytes in this exact order:

$$
{b}_{{0}}={0}
$$
$$
{b}_{{1}}={36}
$$
$$
{b}_{{2}}={8}
$$
$$
{b}_{{3}}={1}
$$
$$
{b}_{{4}}={18}
$$
$$
{b}_{{5}}={32}
$$
$$
{b}_{{{6}.{.37}}}=\ldots
$$

**where**

- ${b}_{{0}}$ is the [multihash prefix](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash#multihash) of value ${0}$ (implying no hashing is used).

- ${b}_{{1}}$ the length of the PeerId (remaining bytes).

- ${b}_{{2}}$ and ${b}_{{3}}$ are a protobuf encoded field-value pair [indicating the used key type](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/peer-ids/peer-ids.md#keys) (field ${1}$ of value ${1}$ implies *ED25519*).

- ${b}_{{4}}$, ${b}_{{5}}$ and ${b}_{{{6}.{.37}}}$ are a protobuf encoded field-value pair where ${b}_{{5}}$ indicates the length of the public key followed by the raw ED25519 public key itself, which varies for each Polkadot Host and is always 32 bytes (field ${2}$ contains the public key, which has a field value length prefix).

:::
## -sec-num- Network bootstrap and discovery {#sect-network-bootstrap}

The Polkadot Host uses various mechanisms to find peers within the network, to establish and maintain a list of peers, and to share that list with other peers from the network as follows:

- **Bootstrap nodes** are hard-coded node identities and addresses provided by the genesis state ([Section -sec-num-ref-](id-cryptography-encoding#section-genesis)).

- **mDNS** is a protocol that performs a broadcast to the local network. Nodes that might be listening can respond to the broadcast. [The libp2p mDNS specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/discovery/mdns.md) defines this process in more detail. This protocol is an optional implementation detail for Polkadot Host implementers and is not required to participate in the Polkadot network.

- **Kademlia requests** invoking Kademlia requests, where nodes respond with their list of available peers. Kademlia requests are performed on a specific substream as described in [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-protocols-substreams).

## -sec-num- Connection establishment {#sect-connection-establishment}

Polkadot nodes connect to peers by establishing a TCP connection. Once established, the node initiates a handshake with the remote peers on the encryption layer. An additional layer on top of the encryption layer, known as the multiplexing layer, allows a connection to be split into substreams, as described by the [yamux specification](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/stream-multiplexing/#yamux), either by the local or remote node.

The Polkadot node supports two types of substream protocols. [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-protocols-substreams) describes the usage of each type in more detail:

- **Request-Response substreams**: After the protocol is negotiated by the multiplexing layer, the initiator sends a single message containing a request. The responder then sends a response, after which the substream is then immediately closed. The requests and responses are prefixed with their [LEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) encoded length.

- **Notification substreams**. After the protocol is negotiated, the initiator sends a single handshake message. The responder can then either accept the substream by sending its own handshake or reject it by closing the substream. After the substream has been accepted, the initiator can send an unbound number of individual messages. The responder keeps its sending side of the substream open, despite not sending anything anymore, and can later close it in order to signal to the initiator that it no longer wishes to communicate.

  Handshakes and messages are prefixed with their [LEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) encoded lengths. A handshake can be empty, in which case the length prefix would be *0*.

Connections are established by using the following protocols:

- `/noise` - a protocol that is announced when a connection to a peer is established.

- `/multistream/1.0.0` - a protocol that is announced when negotiating an encryption protocol or a substream.

- `/yamux/1.0.0` - a protocol used during *yamux* negotiation. See [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-protocols-substreams) for more information.

The Polkadot Host can establish a connection with any peer of which it knows the address. The Polkadot Host supports multiple networking protocols:

- **TCP/IP** with addresses in the form of `/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/30333` to establish a TCP connection and negotiate encryption and a multiplexing layer.

- **WebSocket** with addresses in the form of `/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/30333/ws` to establish a TCP connection and negotiate the WebSocket protocol within the connection. Additionally, the encryption and multiplexing layer are negotiated within the WebSocket connection.

- **DNS** addresses in form of `/dns/example.com/tcp/30333` and `/dns/example.com/tcp/30333/ws`.

The addressing system is described in the [libp2p addressing](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/addressing/) specification. After a base-layer protocol is established, the Polkadot Host will apply the Noise protocol to establish the encryption layer as described in [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-encryption-layer).

## -sec-num- Encryption Layer {#sect-encryption-layer}

Polkadot protocol uses the *libp2p* Noise framework to build an encryption protocol. The Noise protocol is a framework for building encryption protocols. *libp2p* utilizes that protocol for establishing encrypted communication channels. Refer to the [libp2p Secure Channel Handshake](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/noise) specification for a detailed description.

Polkadot nodes use the [XX handshake pattern](https://noiseexplorer.com/patterns/XX/) to establish a connection between peers. The three following steps are required to complete the handshake process:

1.  The initiator generates a key pair and sends the public key to the responder. The [Noise specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/noise) and the [libp2p PeerId specification](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/peer-ids/peer-ids.md) describe keypairs in more detail.

2.  The responder generates its own key pair and sends its public key back to the initiator. After that, the responder derives a shared secret and uses it to encrypt all further communication. The responder now sends its static Noise public key (which may change anytime and does not need to be persisted on disk), its *libp2p* public key, and a signature of the static Noise public key signed with the *libp2p* public key.

3.  The initiator derives a shared secret and uses it to encrypt all further communication. It also sends its static Noise public key, *libp2p* public key, and signature to the responder.

After these three steps, both the initiator and responder derive a new shared secret using the static and session-defined Noise keys, which are used to encrypt all further communication.

## -sec-num- Protocols and Substreams {#sect-protocols-substreams}

After the node establishes a connection with a peer, the use of multiplexing allows the Polkadot Host to open substreams. *libp2p* uses the [*yamux protocol*](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/stream-multiplexing/#yamux) to manage substreams and to allow the negotiation of *application-specific protocols*, where each protocol serves a specific utility.

The Polkadot Host uses multiple substreams whose usage depends on a specific purpose. Each substream is either a *Request-Response substream* or a *Notification substream*, as described in [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-connection-establishment).

:::info
The prefixes on those substreams are known as protocol identifiers and are used to segregate communications to specific networks. This prevents any interference with other networks. `dot` is used exclusively for Polkadot. Kusama, for example, uses the protocol identifier `ksmcc3`.
:::

- `/ipfs/ping/1.0.0` - Open a standardized substream *libp2p* to a peer and initialize a ping to verify if a connection is still alive. If the peer does not respond, the connection is dropped. This is a *Request-Response substream*.

  Further specification and reference implementations are available in the [libp2p documentation](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/protocols/#ping).

- `/ipfs/id/1.0.0` - Open a standardized *libp2p* substream to a peer to ask for information about that peer. This is a *Request-Response substream*, but the initiator does **not** send any message to the responder and only waits for the response.

### -sec-num- Discovering authorities {#sect-authority-discovery}

The discovery mechanism enables Polkadot nodes to both publish their local addresses and learn about other nodes' identifiers and addresses.
The Authority discovery mechanism differs from the bootstrap mechanism, described in [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-networking#sect-network-bootstrap), in that it restricts the discovery output to nodes currently holding the authority role (e.g., validators).

#### -sec-num- Requesting authority identifier and addresses {#sect-auth-discovery-service-requests}

The following requests are exposed by the discovery authority to Polkadot nodes.

###### Definition -def-num- Authority addresses request {#defn-auth-discovery-address-request}

$$

**where**
- $\texttt{authorityId}$ is the `authorityId` 256-bit identifier representing the public key of the targeted authority node. 

**expected response**

<!-- ##### -sec-num- Publishing addresses {#sect-auth-discovery-publishing} -->
The authority discovery mechanism triggers operations to publish a `SignedAuthorityRecord` of the addresses of authorities it knows from its current and next authority sets into the DHT. The `SignedAuthorityRecord` and the publish operation are created as follows:

###### Definition -def-num- Signed Authority Record {#defn-signed-authority-record}
:::definition

The `SignedAuthorityRecord` is a Protobuf serialized structure representing the authority records and signature to send over the wire.

### -sec-num- Announcing blocks {#sect-msg-block-announce}

When the node creates or receives a new block, it must be announced to the network. Other nodes within the network will track this announcement and can request information about this block. The mechanism for tracking announcements and requesting the required data is implementation-specific.

Block announcements, requests, and responses are sent over the substream as described in [Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-block-announce-handshake).

###### Definition -def-num- Block Announce Handshake {#defn-block-announce-handshake}
:::definition

The `BlockAnnounceHandshake` initializes a substream to a remote peer. Once established, all `BlockAnounce` messages ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-block-announce)) created by the node are sent to the `/dot/block-announces/1` substream.

The `BlockAnnounceHandshake` is a structure of the following format:

$$
{B}{A}_{{h}}=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({R},{N}_{{B}},{h}_{{B}},{h}_{{G}}\right)}
$$

**where**

$$

**where**  
- ${B}_{{f}}$ indicates all the fields that should be included in the request. its **big-endian** encoded bitmask that applies to all desired fields with bitwise OR operations. For example, the ${B}_{{f}}$ value to request *Header* and *Justification* is *0001 0001* (17).

| Type                 | Id  | Description                           |
|----------------------|-----|---------------------------------------|
| Repeated *BlockData* | 1   | Block data for the requested sequence |

where *BlockData* is a Protobuf structure containing the requested blocks. Do note that the optional values are either present or absent depending on the requested fields (bitmask value). The structure has the following format:

### -sec-num- Requesting States {#sect-msg-state-request}

The Polkadot Host can request the state in the form of a key/value list at a specified block.

When receiving state entries from the state response messages ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-msg-state-response)), the node can verify the entries with the entry proof (id *1* in *KeyValueStorage*) against the Merkle root in the block header (of the block specified in [Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-msg-state-request)). Once the state response message claims that all entries have been sent (id *3* in *KeyValueStorage*), the node can use all collected entry proofs and validate them against the Merkle root to confirm that claim.

See the synchronization chapter for more information ([Chapter -chap-num-ref-](chap-sync)).

###### Definition -def-num- State Request {#defn-msg-state-request}
:::definition

A **state request** is sent to a peer to request the state at a specified block. The message is a single 32-byte Blake2 hash which indicates the block from which the sync should start.

Depending on what substream is used, the remote peer either sends back a state response ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-msg-state-response)) on the `/dot/state/2` substream or a warp sync proof ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-warp-sync-proof)) on the `/dot/sync/warp`.

:::
###### Definition -def-num- State Response {#defn-msg-state-response}
:::definition

The **state response** is sent to the peer that initialized the state request ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-msg-state-request)) and contains a list of key/value entries with an associated proof. This response is sent continuously until all key/value pairs have been submitted.

| Type                          | Id  | Description   |
|-------------------------------|-----|---------------|
| `repeated KeyValueStateEntry` | 1   | State entries |
| `bytes`                       | 2   | State proof   |

where *KeyValueStateEntry* is of the following format:

| Type                  | Id  | Description                                       |
|-----------------------|-----|---------------------------------------------------|
| `bytes`               | 1   | Root of the entry, empty if top-level             |
| `repeated StateEntry` | 2   | Collection of key/values                          |
| `bool`                | 3   | Equal 'true' if there are no more keys to return. |

and *StateEntry*:

| Type    | Id  | Description            |
|---------|-----|------------------------|
| `bytes` | 1   | The key of the entry   |
| `bytes` | 2   | The value of the entry |

### -sec-num- Warp Sync {#sect-msg-warp-sync}

The warp sync protocols allow nodes to retrieve blocks from remote peers where authority set changes occurred. This can be used to speed up synchronization to the latest state.

See the synchronization chapter for more information ([Chapter -chap-num-ref-](chap-sync)).

###### Definition -def-num- Warp Sync Proof {#defn-warp-sync-proof}
:::definition

The **warp sync proof** message, ${P}$, is sent to the peer that initialized the state request ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-msg-state-request)) on the `/dot/sync/warp` substream and contains accumulated proof of multiple authority set changes ([Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-sync#sect-consensus-message-digest)). Itâ€™s a data structure of the following format:

$$
{P}={\left({{f}_{{x}}\ldots}{{f}_{{y}},}{c}\right)}
$$

${{f}_{{x}}\ldots}{{f}_{{y}}}$ is an array consisting of warp sync fragments of the following format:

$$
{{f}_{{x}}=}{\left({B}_{{h}},{J}^{{{r},\text{stage}}}{\left({B}\right)}\right)}
$$

where ${B}_{{h}}$ is the last block header containing a digest item ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-state#defn-digest)) signaling an authority set change from which the next authority set change can be fetched from. ${J}^{{{r},\text{stage}}}{\left({B}\right)}$ is the GRANDPA justification ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-grandpa-justification)) and ${c}$ is a boolean that indicates whether the warp sync has been completed.

:::
### -sec-num- Transactions {#sect-msg-transactions}

Transactions ([Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-state#sect-extrinsics)) are sent directly to peers with which the Polkadot Host has an open transaction substream ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-transactions-message)). Polkadot Host implementers should implement a mechanism that only sends a transaction once to each peer and avoids sending duplicates. Sending duplicate transactions might result in undefined consequences such as being blocked for bad behavior by peers.

The mechanism for managing transactions is further described in Section [Section -sec-num-ref-](chap-state#sect-extrinsics).

###### Definition -def-num- Transaction Message {#defn-transactions-message}
:::definition

The **transactions message** is the structure of how the transactions are sent over the network. It is represented by ${M}_{{T}}$ and is defined as follows:

$$
{M}_{{T}}\:=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({C}_{{1}},\ldots,{C}_{{n}}\right)}
$$

**in which**

$$
{C}_{{i}}\:=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({E}_{{i}}\right)}$$

Where each ${E}_{{i}}$ is a byte array and represents a separate extrinsic. The Polkadot Host is agnostic about the content of an extrinsic and treats it as a blob of data.

Transactions are sent over the `/dot/transactions/1` substream.

:::
### -sec-num- GRANDPA Messages {#sect-msg-grandpa}

The exchange of GRANDPA messages is conducted on the substream. The process for the creation and distribution of these messages is described in [Chapter -chap-num-ref-](sect-finality). The underlying messages are specified in this section.

###### Definition -def-num- Grandpa Gossip Message {#defn-gossip-message}
:::definition

A **GRANDPA gossip message**, ${M}$, is a varying datatype ([Definition -def-num-ref-](id-cryptography-encoding#defn-varrying-data-type)) which identifies the message type that is cast by a voter followed by the message itself.

$$
{M}={\left\lbrace\begin{matrix}{0}&\text{Vote message}&{V}_{{m}}\\{1}&\text{Commit message}&{C}_{{m}}\\{2}&\text{Neighbor message}&{N}_{{m}}\\{3}&\text{Catch-up request message}&{R}_{{m}}\\{4}&\text{Catch-up message}&{U}_{{m}}\end{matrix}\right.}

- ${U}_{{M}}$ is defined in [Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-grandpa-catchup-response-msg).

:::
###### Definition -def-num- GRANDPA Vote Messages {#defn-grandpa-vote-msg}
:::definition

A **GRANDPA vote message** by voter ${v}$, ${{M}_{{v}}^{{{r},\text{stage}}}}$, is gossip to the network by voter ${v}$ with the following structure:

$$
{{M}_{{v}}^{{{r},\text{stage}}}}{\left({B}\right)}\:=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({r},\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}},\text{SigMsg}\right)}
$$
$$
\text{SigMsg}\:={\left(\text{msg},{\text{Sig}_{{{v}_{{i}}}}^{{{r},\text{stage}}}},{v}_{{\text{id}}}\right)}
$$
$$
\text{msg}\:=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left(\text{stage},{{V}_{{v}}^{{{r},\text{stage}}}}{\left({B}\right)}\right)}

- $\text{stage}$ is a 8-bit integer of value *0* if itâ€™s a pre-vote sub-round, *1* if itâ€™s a pre-commit sub-round or *2* if itâ€™s a primary proposal message.

- ${{V}_{{v}}^{{{r},\text{stage}}}}{\left({B}\right)}$ is the GRANDPA vote for block ${B}$ ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-voting-rounds)).

This message is the sub-component of the GRANDPA gossip message ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-gossip-message)) of type Id 0.

:::
###### Definition -def-num- GRANDPA Compact Justification Format {#defn-grandpa-justifications-compact}
:::definition

The **GRANDPA compact justification format** is an optimized data structure to store a collection of pre-commits and their signatures to be submitted as part of a commit message. Instead of storing an array of justifications, it uses the following format:

$$
{{J}_{{{v}_{{{0},\ldots{n}}}}}^{{{r},\text{comp}}}}\:={\left({\left\lbrace{{V}_{{{v}_{{0}}}}^{{{r},{p}{c}}}},\ldots{{V}_{{{v}_{{n}}}}^{{{r},{p}{c}}}}\right\rbrace},{\left\lbrace{\left({\text{Sig}_{{{v}_{{0}}}}^{{{r},{p}{c}}}},{v}_{{\text{id}_{{0}}}}\right)},\ldots{\left({\text{Sig}_{{{v}_{{n}}}}^{{{r},{p}{c}}}},{v}_{{\text{id}_{{n}}}}\right)}\right\rbrace}\right)}
$$

**where**  
- ${{V}_{{{v}_{{i}}}}^{{{r},{p}{c}}}}$ is a 256-bit byte array containing the pre-commit vote of authority ${v}_{{i}}$ ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-voting-rounds)).

- ${\text{Sig}_{{{v}_{{i}}}}^{{{r},{p}{c}}}}$ is a 512-bit byte array containing the pre-commit signature of authority ${v}_{{i}}$ ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-sign-round-vote)).

- ${v}_{{\text{id}_{{n}}}}$ is a 256-bit byte array containing the public key of authority ${v}_{{i}}$.

:::
###### Definition -def-num- GRANDPA Commit Message {#defn-grandpa-commit-msg}
:::definition

A **GRANDPA commit message** for block ${B}$ in round ${r}$, ${{M}_{{v}}^{{{r},\text{Fin}}}}{\left({B}\right)}$, is a message broadcasted by voter ${v}$ to the network indicating that voter ${v}$ has finalized block ${B}$ in round ${r}$. It has the following structure:

$$
{{M}_{{v}}^{{{r},\text{Fin}}}}{\left({B}\right)}\:=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({r},\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}},{{V}_{{v}}^{{r}}}{\left({B}\right)},{{J}_{{{v}_{{{0},\ldots{n}}}}}^{{{r},\text{comp}}}}\right)}
$$

**where**  
- ${r}$ is an unsigned 64-bit integer indicating the round number ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-voting-rounds)).

This message is the sub-component of the GRANDPA gossip message ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-gossip-message)) of type Id *1*.

:::
#### -sec-num- GRANDPA Neighbor Messages {#sect-grandpa-neighbor-msg}

Neighbor messages are sent to all connected peers but they are not repropagated on reception. A message should be sent whenever the values of the message change and at least every 5 minutes. The sender should take the recipient's state into account and avoid sending messages to peers that are using different voter sets or are in a different round. Messages received from a future voter set or round can be dropped and ignored.

###### Definition -def-num- GRANDPA Neighbor Message {#defn-grandpa-neighbor-msg}
:::definition

A **GRANDPA Neighbor Message** is defined as:

$$
{M}^{{\text{neigh}}}\:=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({v},{r},\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}},{H}_{{i}}{\left({B}_{{\text{last}}}\right)}\right)}
$$

**where**  
- ${v}$ is an unsigned 8-bit integer indicating the version of the neighbor message, currently *1*.

- ${r}$ is an unsigned 64-bit integer indicating the round number ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-voting-rounds)).

- $\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}}$ is an unsigned 64-bit integer indicating the authority Id ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-authority-set-id)).

- ${H}_{{i}}{\left({B}_{{\text{last}}}\right)}$ is an unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the block number of the last finalized block ${B}_{{\text{last}}}$.

This message is the sub-component of the GRANDPA gossip message ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-gossip-message)) of type Id *2*.

:::
#### -sec-num- GRANDPA Catch-up Messages {#sect-grandpa-catchup-messages}

Whenever a Polkadot node detects that it is lagging behind the finality procedure, it needs to initiate a *catch-up* procedure. GRANDPA Neighbor messages ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-grandpa-neighbor-msg)) reveal the round number for the last finalized GRANDPA round which the nodeâ€™s peers have observed. This provides the means to identify a discrepancy in the latest finalized round number observed among the peers. If such a discrepancy is observed, the node needs to initiate the catch-up procedure explained in [Section -sec-num-ref-](sect-finality#sect-grandpa-catchup)).

In particular, this procedure involves sending a *catch-up request* and processing *catch-up response* messages.

###### Definition -def-num- Catch-Up Request Message {#defn-grandpa-catchup-request-msg}
:::definition

A **GRANDPA catch-up request message** for round ${r}$, ${{M}_{{{i},{v}}}^{{\text{Cat}-{q}}}}{\left(\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}},{r}\right)}$, is a message sent from node ${i}$ to its voting peer node ${v}$ requesting the latest status of a GRANDPA round ${r}'>{r}$ of the authority set ${\mathbb{{V}}}_{{\text{id}}}$ along with the justification of the status and has the following structure:

$$
{{M}_{{{i},{v}}}^{{{r},\text{Cat}-{q}}}}\:=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({r},\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}}\right)}

:::definition

A **GRANDPA catch-up response message** for round ${r}$, ${{M}_{{{v},{i}}}^{{\text{Cat}-{s}}}}{\left(\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}},{r}\right)}$, is a message sent by a node ${v}$ to node ${i}$ in response of a catch-up request ${{M}_{{{v},{i}}}^{{\text{Cat}-{q}}}}{\left(\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}},{r}'\right)}$ in which ${r}\ge{r}'$ is the latest GRANDPA round which v has prove of its finalization and has the following structure:

$$
{{M}_{{{v},{i}}}^{{\text{Cat}-{s}}}}\:=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left(\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}},{r},{{J}_{{{0},\ldots{n}}}^{{{r},\text{pv}}}}{\left({B}\right)},{{J}_{{{0},\ldots{m}}}^{{{r},\text{pc}}}}{\left({B}\right)},{H}_{{h}}{\left({B}'\right)},{H}_{{i}}{\left({B}'\right)}\right)}
$$

Where ${B}$ is the highest block which ${v}$ believes to be finalized in round ${r}$ ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-voting-rounds)). ${B}'$ is the highest ancestor of all blocks voted on in the arrays of justifications ${{J}_{{{0},\ldots{n}}}^{{{r},\text{pv}}}}{\left({B}\right)}$ and ${{J}_{{{0},\ldots{m}}}^{{{r},\text{pc}}}}{\left({B}\right)}$ ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-grandpa-justification)) with the exception of the equivocatory votes.

A **commitment**, ${C}$, contains the information extracted from the finalized block at height ${H}_{{i}}{\left({B}_{{\text{last}}}\right)}$ as specified in the message body and a datastructure of the following format:
$$
{C}={\left({R}_{{h}},{H}_{{i}}{\left({B}_{{\text{last}}}\right)},\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}}\right)}
$$
**where**  
- ${R}_{{h}}$ is the MMR root of all the block header hashes leading up to the latest, finalized block.
- ${H}_{{i}}{\left({B}_{{\text{last}}}\right)}$ is the block number this commitment is for. Namely the latest, finalized block.
- $\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}}$ is the current authority set Id ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-authority-set-id)).
:::
###### Definition -def-num- Vote Message {#defn-msg-beefy-gossip}
:::definition
A **vote message**, ${M}_{{v}}$, is direct vote created by the Polkadot Host on every BEEFY round and is gossiped to its peers. The message is a datastructure of the following format:
$$
{M}_{{v}}=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({C},{{A}_{{\text{id}}}^{{\text{bfy}}}},{A}_{{\text{sig}}}\right)}
$$
**where**  
- ${C}$ is the BEEFY commitment ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-grandpa-beefy-commitment)).
- ${{A}_{{\text{id}}}^{{\text{bfy}}}}$ is the ECDSA public key of the Polkadot Host.
- ${A}_{{\text{sig}}}$ is the signature created with ${{A}_{{\text{id}}}^{{\text{bfy}}}}$ by signing the payload ${R}_{{h}}$ in ${C}$.
:::
###### Definition -def-num- Signed Commitment {#defn-grandpa-beefy-signed-commitment}
:::definition
A **signed commitment**, ${M}_{{\text{sc}}}$, is a datastructure of the following format:
$$
{M}_{{\text{SC}}}=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({C},{S}_{{n}}\right)}
$$
$$
{S}_{{n}}={\left({{A}_{{0}}^{{\text{sig}}}},\ldots{{A}_{{n}}^{{\text{sig}}}}\right)}
$$
**where**  
- ${C}$ is the BEEFY commitment ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-grandpa-beefy-commitment)).
- ${S}_{{n}}$ is an array where its exact size matches the number of validators in the current authority set as specified by $\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}}$ ([Definition -def-num-ref-](sect-finality#defn-authority-set-id)) in ${C}$. Individual items are of the type *Option* ([Definition -def-num-ref-](id-cryptography-encoding#defn-option-type)), which can contain a signature of a validator which signed the same payload (${R}_{{h}}$ in ${C}$) and is active in the current authority set. Itâ€™s critical that the signatures are sorted based on their corresponding public key entry in the authority set.
  For example, the signature of the validator at index 3 in the authority set must be placed at index *3* in ${S}_{{n}}$. If not signature is available for that validator, then the *Option* variant is *None* inserted ([Definition -def-num-ref-](id-cryptography-encoding#defn-option-type)). This sorting allows clients to map public keys to their corresponding signatures.
:::
###### Definition -def-num- Signed Commitment Witness {#defn-grandpa-beefy-signed-commitment-witness}
:::definition
A **signed commitment witness**, ${{M}_{{\text{SC}}}^{{w}}}$, is a light version of the signed BEEFY commitment ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-grandpa-beefy-signed-commitment)). Instead of containing the entire list of signatures, it only claims which validator signed the payload.
The message is a datastructure of the following format:
$$
{{M}_{{\text{SC}}}^{{w}}}=\text{Enc}_{{\text{SC}}}{\left({C},{V}_{{{0},\ldots{n}}},{R}_{{\text{sig}}}\right)}
$$
**where**  
- ${C}$ is the BEEFY commitment ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-grandpa-beefy-commitment)).
- ${V}_{{{0},\ldots{n}}}$ is an array where its exact size matches the number of validators in the current authority set as specified by $\text{id}_{{{\mathbb{{V}}}}}$ in ${C}$. Individual items are booleans which indicate whether the validator has signed the payload (*true*) or not (*false*). Itâ€™s critical that the boolean indicators are sorted based on their corresponding public key entry in the authority set.
  For example, the boolean indicator of the validator at index 3 in the authority set must be placed at index *3* in ${V}_{{n}}$. This sorting allows clients to map public keys to their corresponding boolean indicators.
- ${R}_{{\text{sig}}}$ is the MMR root of the signatures in the original signed BEEFY commitment ([Definition -def-num-ref-](chap-networking#defn-grandpa-beefy-signed-commitment)).
