[#defn-state-version]
.<<defn-state-version, State Version>>
====
The state version, stem:[v], dictates how a merkle root should be constructed.
The datastructure is a varying type of the following format:

[stem]
++++
v = {(0, "full values"),(1, "node hashes"):}
++++

where stem:[0] indicates that the values of the keys should be inserted into the
trie directly and stem:[1] makes use of "node hashes" when calculating the
merkle proof (<<defn-hashed-subvalue>>).
