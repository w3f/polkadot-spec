==== `ext_trie_blake2_256_root`

Compute a 256-bit Blake2 trie root formed from the iterated items.

===== Version 1 - Prototype
----
(func $ext_trie_blake2_256_root_version_1
	(param $data i64) (result i32))
----

Arguments::

* `data`: a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer-size>>) to the
iterated items from which the trie root gets formed. The items consist of a
SCALE encoded array containing arbitrary key/value pairs (tuples).
* `result`: a pointer (<<defn-runtime-pointer>>) to the buffer containing the 256-bit trie root.

	(param $data i64) (param $version i32)
	(result i32))

Arguments::

* `data`: a pointer-size (<<defn-runtime-pointer-size>>) to the
iterated items from which the trie root gets formed. The items consist of a
SCALE encoded array containing arbitrary key/value pairs (tuples).
