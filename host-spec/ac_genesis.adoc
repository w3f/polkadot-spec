The genesis state is a set of key-value pairs representing the intial state of
the Polkadot state storage. It can be retrieved from . While each of those
key-value pairs offers important identifyable information to the Runtime, to the
Polkadot Host they are a transparent set of arbitrary chain- and
network-dependent keys and values. The only exception to this are the `:code`
(<<sect-loading-runtime-code>>) and `:heappages` (<<sect-memory-management>>)
keys, which are used by the Polkadot Host to initialize the WASM environment and
its Runtime. The other keys and values are unspecified and solely depend on the
chain and respectively its corresponding Runtime. On initialization the data
should be inserted into the state storage with the Host API
(<<sect-storage-set>>).

As such, Polkadot does not defined a formal genesis block. Nonetheless for the
compatibility reasons in several algorithms, the Polkadot Host defines the
_genesis header_ (<<defn-genesis-header>>). By the abuse of terminology,
"genesis block" refers to the hypothetical parent of block number _1_ which
holds genisis header as its header.

[#defn-genesis-header]
The Polkadot genesis
header is a data structure conforming to block header format (<<defn-block-header>>). It contains the following
values:

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Block header field |Genesis Header Value

|`parent_hash`
|_0_

|`number`
|_0_

|`state_root`
|Merkle hash of the state storage trie (<<defn-merkle-value>>) after inserting the genesis state in it.

|`extrinsics_root`
|_0_

|`digest`
|_0_
|===
