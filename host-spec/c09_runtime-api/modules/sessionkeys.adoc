[#sect-runtime-sessionkeys-module]
==== SessionKeys Module (Version 1)

All calls in this module require `Core_initialize_block` (<<sect-rte-core-initialize-block>>) to be called beforehand.

===== `SessionKeys_generate_session_keys`

Generates a set of session keys with an optional seed. The keys should
be stored within the keystore exposed by the Host Api. The seed needs to
be valid and UTF-8 encoded.

Arguments::
* A SCALE-encoded _Option_ as defined in <<defn-option-type>> containing an array of varying sizes indicating the seed.

Return::
* A byte array of varying size containg the encoded session keys.

===== `SessionKeys_decode_session_keys`

Decodes the given public session keys. Returns a list of raw public keys including their key type.

Arguments::
* An array of varying size containing the encoded public session keys.

Return::
* An array of varying size containing tuple pairs of the following format:
+
[latexmath]
++++
(k, k_{\operatorname{id}})
++++
where latexmath:[k] is an array of varying sizes containg the raw
public key and latexmath:[k_{\operatorname{id}}] is a
4-byte array indicating the key type.
