==== GrandpaApi Module (Version 2)

All calls in this module require `Core_initalize_block` (<<sect-rte-core-initialize-block>>) to be called beforehand.

[#sect-rte-grandpa-auth]
===== `GrandpaApi_grandpa_authorities`

This entry fetches the list of GRANDPA authorities according to the
genesis block and is used to initialize an authority list at genesis,
defined in <<defn-authority-list>>.
Any future authority changes get tracked via Runtime-to-consensus engine
messages, as described in <<sect-consensus-message-digest>>.

Arguments::
* None.

Return::
* An authority list as defined in <<defn-authority-list>>.

[#sect-grandpaapi_submit_report_equivocation_unsigned_extrinsic]
===== `GrandpaApi_submit_report_equivocation_unsigned_extrinsic`

A GRANDPA equivocation occurs when a validator votes for multiple blocks
during one voting subround, as described further in <<defn-equivocation>>. The Polkadot Host is expected to identify equivocators and report those to the Runtime by
calling this function.

Arguments::
* The equivocation proof of the following format:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{aligned}
    G_{\operatorname{Ep}} = & (\operatorname{id}_{\mathbb{V}}, e, r, A_{\operatorname{id}}, B^1_h,
    B^1_n A^1_{\operatorname{sig}}, B^2_h, B^2_n, A^2_{\operatorname{sig}})\\
    e = & \left\{\begin{array}{l}
      0 \quad \textrm{Equivocation at prevote stage}\\
      1 \quad \textrm{Equivocation at precommit stage}
    \end{array}\right.
\end{aligned}
++++

where:::
** latexmath:[\operatorname{id}_{\mathbb{V}}] is the authority set as defined in <<defn-authority-set-id>>.
** latexmath:[e] indicates the stage at which the equivocation occurred.
** latexmath:[r] is the round number the equivocation occurred.
** latexmath:[A_{\operatorname{id}}] is the public key of the equivocator.
** latexmath:[B^1_h] is the block hash of the first block the equivocator voted for.
** latexmath:[B^1_n] is the block number of the first block the equivocator voted for.
** latexmath:[A^1_{\operatorname{sig}}] is the equivocators signature of the first vote.
** latexmath:[B^2_h] is the block hash of the second block the equivocator voted for.
** latexmath:[B^2_n] is the block number of the second block the equivocator voted for.
** latexmath:[A^2_{\operatorname{sig}}] is the equivocators signature of the second vote.
* A proof of the key owner in an opaque form as described in <<sect-grandpaapi_generate_key_ownership_proof>>.

Return::
* A SCALE encoded _Option_ as defined in <<defn-option-type>> containing an empty value on success.

[#sect-grandpaapi_generate_key_ownership_proof]
===== `GrandpaApi_generate_key_ownership_proof`

Generates proof of the membership of a key owner in the specified block
state. The returned value is used to report equivocations as described
in <<sect-grandpaapi_submit_report_equivocation_unsigned_extrinsic>>.

Arguments::
* The authority set id as defined in <<defn-authority-set-id>>.
* The 256-bit public key of the authority.

Return::
* A SCALE encoded _Option_ as defined in <<defn-option-type>> containing the proof in an opaque form.
