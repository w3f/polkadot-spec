== Consensus

=== BABE digest messages

The Runtime is required to provide the BABE authority list and
randomness to the host via a consensus message in the header of the
first block of each epoch.

The digest published in Epoch latexmath:[$\mathcal{E}_n$] is enacted in
latexmath:[$\mathcal{E}_{n+1}$]. The randomness in this digest is
computed based on the all the VRF outputs up to including Epoch
latexmath:[$\mathcal{E}_{n-2}$] while the authority set is based on all
transaction included up to Epoch latexmath:[$\mathcal{E}_{n-1}$].

The computation of the randomeness seed is described in Algorithm
link:#algo-epoch-randomness[[algo-epoch-randomness]] which uses the
concept of epoch subchain as described in host specification and the
value latexmath:[$d_B$], which is the VRF output computed for slot
latexmath:[$s_B$].
