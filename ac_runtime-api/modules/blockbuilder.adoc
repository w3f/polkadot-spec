[#sect-runtime-blockbuilder-module]
=== BlockBuilder Module (Version 4)

All calls in this module require `Core_intialize_block`
(<<sect-rte-core-initialize-block>>) to be called beforehand.

[#sect-rte-apply-extrinsic]
==== `BlockBuilder_apply_extrinsic`

Apply the extrinsic outside of the block execution function. This does
not attempt to validate anything regarding the block, but it builds a
list of transaction hashes.

Arguments::
* A byte array of varying size containing the opaque extrinsic.

Return::
* Returns the varying datatype _ApplyExtrinsicResult_ as defined in <<defn-rte-apply-extrinsic-result>>.
This structure lets the block builder know whether an extrinsic should
be included into the block or rejected.

.ApplyExtrinsicResult
[#defn-rte-apply-extrinsic-result]
====
*ApplyExtrinsicResult* is a varying data type as defined in <<defn-result-type>>.
This structure can contain multiple nested structures, indicating either module
dispatch outcomes or transaction invalidity errors.

.Possible values of varying data type _ApplyExtrinsicResult_.
[cols="<1,<6,<3",options="header"]
|===
|*Id* |*Description* |*Type*

|0 |Outcome of dispatching the extrinsic.
|_DispatchOutcome_ (<<defn-rte-dispatch-outcome>>)

|1 |Possible errors while checking the validity of a transaction.
|_TransactionValidityError_ (<<defn-rte-transaction-validity-error>>)
|===
====

NOTE: As long as a _DispatchOutcome_ (<<defn-rte-dispatch-outcome>>) is returned,
the extrinsic is always included in the block, even if the outcome is a dispatch
error. Dispatch errors do not invalidate the block and all state changes are
persisted.

.DispatchOutcome
[#defn-rte-dispatch-outcome]
====
*DispatchOutcome* is the varying data type as defined in <<defn-result-type>>.

.Possible values of varying data type _DispatchOutcome_.

|===
====

.DispatchError
[#defn-rte-dispatch-error]
====
*DispatchError* is a varying data type as defined in <<defn-varrying-data-type>>.
Indicates various reasons why a dispatch call failed.

.Possible values of varying data type _DispatchError_.
[cols="<1,<4,<5",options="header",]
|===
|*Id* |*Description* |*Type*
|0 |Some unknown error occurred. |SCALE encoded byte array containing a valid UTF-8 sequence.

|1 |Failed to lookup some data. |None

|3 |A custom error in a module. | _CustomModuleError_ (<<defn-rte-custom-module-error>>)
|===
====

.CustomModuleError
[#defn-rte-custom-module-error]
====
*CustomModuleError* is a tuple appended after a possible error in as defined in <<defn-rte-dispatch-error>>.

.Possible values of varying data type _CustomModuleError_.
[cols="<2,<4,<4",options="header",]
|===
|*Name* |*Description* |*Type*
|Index |Module index matching the metadata module index. |Unsigned 8-bit integer.

|Error |Module specific error value. |Unsigned 8-bit integer

|Message |Optional error message. |Varying data type _Option_ (<<defn-option-type>>).
The optional value is a SCALE encoded byte array containing a valid UTF-8 sequence.
|===
====

NOTE: Whenever _TransactionValidityError_ (<<defn-rte-transaction-validity-error>>)
is returned, the contained error type will indicate whether an extrinsic should
be outright rejected or requested for a later block. This behaviour is clarified
further in <<defn-rte-invalid-transaction>> and respectively <<defn-rte-unknown-transaction>>.

.TransactionValidityError
[#defn-rte-transaction-validity-error]
====
*TransactionValidityError* is a varying data type as defined in <<defn-varrying-data-type>>.
It indicates possible errors that can occur while checking the validity of a transaction.

|===
|*Id* |*Description* |*Type*
|0 |Transaction is invalid. |_InvalidTransaction_ (<<defn-rte-invalid-transaction>>)

|1 |Transaction validity can’t be determined. |_UnknownTransaction_ (<<defn-rte-unknown-transaction>>)
|===
====

.InvalidTransaction
[#defn-rte-invalid-transaction]
====
*InvalidTransaction* is a varying data type as defined in <<defn-varrying-data-type>>
and specifies the invalidity of the transaction in more detail.

.Possible values of varying data type _InvalidTransaction_.
[cols="<1,<6,<2,<2",options="header"]
|===
|*Id* |*Description* |*Type* |*Reject*
|0 |Call of the transaction is not expected. |None |Yes
|1 |General error to do with the inability to pay some fees (e.g. account balance too low). |None |Yes
|2 |General error to do with the transaction not yet being valid (e.g. nonce too high). |None |No
|3 |General error to do with the transaction being outdated (e.g. nonce too low). |None |Yes
|4 |General error to do with the transactions’ proof (e.g. signature) |None |Yes
|5 |The transaction birth block is ancient. |None |Yes
|6 |The transaction would exhaust the resources of the current block. |None |No
|7 |Some unknown error occured. |Unsigned 8-bit integer |Yes
|8 |An extrinsic with mandatory dispatch resulted in an error. |None |Yes
|9 |A transaction with a mandatory dispatch (only inherents are allowed to have mandatory dispatch). |None |Yes

[#defn-rte-unknown-transaction]
====
*UnknownTransaction* is a varying data type as defined in <<defn-varrying-data-type>>
and specifies the unknown invalidity of the transaction in more detail.

|===
|*Id* |*Description* |*Type* |*Reject*

[#defn-rt-blockbuilder-finalize-block]
==== `BlockBuilder_finalize_block`

Finalize the block - it is up to the caller to ensure that all header
fields are valid except for the state root. State changes resulting from
calling this function are usually meant to persist upon successful
execution of the function and appending of the block to the chain.

Arguments::
* None.

Return::
* The header of the new block as defined in <<defn-block-header>>.

[#defn-rt-builder-inherent-extrinsics]
==== `BlockBuilder_inherent_extrinisics`:

Generates the inherent extrinsics, which are explained in more detail in
<<sect-inherents>>. This function takes a SCALE-encoded hash table as defined in
<<defn-scale-list>> and returns an array of extrinsics. The Polkadot Host must
submit each of those to the `BlockBuilder_apply_extrinsic`, described in
<<sect-rte-apply-extrinsic>>. This procedure is outlined in <<algo-build-block>>.

Arguments::
* A Inherents-Data structure as defined in <<defn-inherent-data>>.

Return::
* A byte array of varying size containing extrinisics. Each extrinsic is a byte
array of varying size.

==== `BlockBuilder_check_inherents`

Checks whether the provided inherent is valid. This function can be used
by the Polkadot Host when deemed appropriate, e.g. during the
block-building process.

Arguments::
* A block represented as a tuple consisting of a block header as described in
<<defn-block-header>> and the block body as described in <<defn-block-body>>.
* A Inherents-Data structure as defined in <<defn-inherent-data>>.

Return::
* A data structure of the following format:
+
[latexmath]
++++
(o, f_e, e)
++++
+
where

** latexmath:[o] is a boolean indicating whether the check was successful.
** latexmath:[f_e] is a boolean indicating whether a fatal error was encountered.
** latexmath:[e] is a Inherents-Data structure as defined in <<defn-inherent-data>>
containing any errors created by this Runtime function.

==== `BlockBuilder_random_seed`

Generates a random seed.

Arguments::
* None

Return::
* A 32-byte array containing the random seed.
