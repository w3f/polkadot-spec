=== Runtime Call Convention

.Runtime API Call Convention
[#defn-runtime-api-convention]
====
The *Runtime API Call Convention* describes that all functions receive and
return SCALE-encoded data and as a result have the following prototype
signature:

[source,wat]
----
(func $generic_runtime_entry
  (param $ptr i32) (parm $len i32) (result i64))
----

where `ptr` points to the SCALE encoded tuple of the parameters passed to the
function and `len` is the length of this data, while `result` is a pointer-size
(Definition <<defn-runtime-pointer-size>>) to the SCALE-encoded return data.
====

See <<sect-code-executor>> for more information about the behavior of the Wasm
Runtime. Also note that any storage changes must be fork-aware
(<<sect-managing-multiple-states>>).
