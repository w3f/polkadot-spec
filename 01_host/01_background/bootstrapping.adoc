=== Bootstrapping

This section provides an overview over the tasks a Polkadot Host needs to
perform in order to join and participate in the Polkadot network. While this
chapter does not go into any new specifications of the protocol, it has been
included to provide implementors with a pointer to what these steps are and
where they are defined. In short, the following steps should be taken by all
bootstrapping nodes:

. The node must populate the state storage with the official genesis state,
clarifier further in <<chapter-genesis>>.
. The node should maintain a set of around 50 active peers at any time. New
peers can be found using the discovery protocols (<<sect-discovery-mechanism>>)
. The node should open and maintain the various required streams
(<<sect-protocols-substreams>>) with each of its active peers.
. Furthermore, the node should send block requests (<<sect-msg-block-request>>)
to these peers to receive all blocks in the chain and execute each of them.
. The node should exchange neighbor packets (<<sect-grandpa-neighbor-msg>>).

Validator nodes should take the following, additional steps.

. Verify that the Host’s session key is included in the current Epoch’s
authority set (<<sect-authority-set>>).
. Run the BABE lottery (<<sect-block-production>>) and wait for the next
assigned slot in order to produce a block.
. Gossip any produced blocks to all connected peers
(<<sect-msg-block-announce>>).
. Run the catch-up protocol (<<sect-grandpa-catchup>>) to make sure that the
node is participating in the current round and not a past round.
. Run the GRANDPA rounds protocol (<<sect-finality>>).
