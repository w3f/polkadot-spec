[#defn-state-machine]
.<<defn-state-machine, Discrete State Machine (DSM)>>
====
A *Discrete State Machine (DSM)* is a state transition system that admits a
starting state and whose set of states and set of transitions are countable.
Formally, it is a tuple of

[stem]
++++
(\Sigma, S, s_0, \delta)
++++
where

* stem:[\Sigma] is the countable set of all possible transitions.
* stem:[S] is a countable set of all possible states.
* stem:[s_0 in S] is the initial state.
* stem:[\delta] is the state-transition function, known as *Runtime* in the
Polkadot vocabulary, such that

[stem]
++++
\delta : S \times \Sigma \rightarrow S
++++

[#defn-path-graph]
.<<defn-path-graph, Path Graph>>
====
A *path graph* or a *path* of stem:[n] nodes formally referred to as *stem:[P_n]*,
is a tree with two nodes of vertex degree 1 and the other n-2 nodes of vertex
degree 2. Therefore, stem:[P_n] can be represented by sequences of stem:[(v_1,
\ldots, v_n)] where stem:[e_i = (v_i, v_{i + 1})] for stem:[1 <= i <= n - 1] is
the edge which connect stem:[v_i] and stem:[v_{i + 1}].
====

[#defn-blockchain]
.<<defn-blockchain, Blockchain>>
====
A *blockchain* stem:[C] is a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph[directed path graph]. Each node of
the graph is called *Block* and indicated by *stem:[B]*. The unique sink of
stem:[C] is called *Genesis Block*, and the source is called the stem:["Head"]
of stem:[C]. For any vertex stem:[(B_1, B_2)] where stem:[B_1 -> B_2] we say
stem:[B_2] is the *parent* of stem:[B_1], which is the *child* of stem:[B_2],
respectively. We indicate that by:

[stem]
++++
B_2 := P(B_1)
++++

The parent refers to the child by its hash value (<<defn-block-header>>), making
the path graph tamper proof since any modifications to the child would result in
its hash value being changed.

NOTE: The term "blockchain" can also be used as a way to refer to the network or
system that interacts or maintains the directed path graph.
====

[#defn-unix-time]
.<<defn-unix-time, Unix Time>>
====
By *Unix time*, we refer to the unsigned, little-endian encoded 64-bit integer
which stores the number of *milliseconds* that have elapsed since the Unix
epoch, that is the time 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, minus leap seconds. Leap
seconds are ignored, and every day is treated as if it contained exactly 86â€™400
seconds.
====

==== Block Tree

In the course of formation of a (distributed) blockchain, it is possible
that the chain forks into multiple subchains in various block positions.
We refer to this structure as a _block tree_:

[#defn-block-tree]
.<<defn-block-tree, Block >>
====
The *block tree* of a blockchain, denoted by stem:[BT] is the union of all
different versions of the blockchain observed by the Polkadot Host such that
every block is a node in the graph and stem:[B_1] is connected to stem:[B_2] if
stem:[B_1] is a parent of stem:[B_2].
====

When a block in the block tree gets finalized, there is an opportunity to prune
the block tree to free up resources into branches of blocks that do not contain
all of the finalized blocks or those that can never be finalized in the
blockchain (<<sect-finality>>).

[#defn-pruned-tree]
.<<defn-pruned-tree, Pruned Block Tree>>
====
By *Pruned Block Tree*, denoted by stem:["PBT"], we refer to a subtree of the block
tree obtained by eliminating all branches which do not contain the most recent
finalized blocks (<<defn-finalized-block>>). By *pruning*, we refer to the
procedure of stem:[BT larr "PBT"]. When there is no risk of ambiguity and is safe
to prune BT, we use stem:["BT"] to refer to stem:["PBT"].
====

<<defn-chain-subchain>> gives the means to highlight various branches of the
block tree.

[#defn-chain-subchain]
.<<defn-chain-subchain, Subchain>>
====
Let stem:[G] be the root of the block tree and stem:[B] be one of its nodes. By
stem:["Chain"(B)], we refer to the path graph from stem:[G] to stem:[B] in
stem:["BT"]. Conversely, for a chain stem:[C = "Chain"(B)], we define *the
head of stem:[C]* to be stem:[B], formally noted as stem:[B := bar C]. We define
stem:[|C|], the length of stem:[C] as a path graph.

If stem:[B'] is another node on stem:["Chain"(B)], then by stem:["SubChain"(B',
B)] we refer to the subgraph of stem:["Chain"(B)] path graph which contains
stem:[B] and ends at stem:[B'] and by stem:[|"SubChain"(B', B)|] we refer to its
length.

Accordingly, stem:[bbb C_(B')(BT)] is the set of all subchains of stem:[BT]
rooted at stem:[B']. The set of all chains of stem:[BT], stem:[bbb C_G(BT))] is
denoted by stem:[bbb C(BT)] or simply stem:[bbb C], for the sake of brevity.
====

[#defn-longest-chain]
.<<defn-longest-chain, Longest Chain>>
====
We define the following complete order over stem:[bbb C] such that for
stem:[C_1, C_2 in bbb C] if stem:[|C_1| != |C_2|] we say stem:[C_1 > C_2] if
and only if stem:[|C_1| > |C_2|].

If stem:[|C_1| =| C_2|] we say stem:[C_1 > C_2] if and only if the block arrival
time of stem:[bar C_1] is less than the block arrival time of stem:[bar C_2]
(<<defn-block-time>>). We define the stem:["Longest-Chain"(BT)] too be the
maximum chain given by this order.
====

[#defn-longest-path]
.<<defn-longest-path, Longest Path>>
====
stem:["Longest-Path"(BT)] returns the path graph of stem:[BT] which is the
longest among all paths in stem:[BT] and has the earliest block arrival time
(<<defn-block-time>>). stem:["Deepest-Leaf"(BT)] returns the head of stem:["Longest-Path"(BT)] chain.
====

Because every block in the blockchain contains a reference to its parent, it is
easy to see that the block tree is de facto a tree. A block tree naturally
imposes partial order relationships on the blocks as follows:

[#defn-descendant]
.<<defn-descendant, Descendant>>
====
We say *B is descendant of stem:[B']*, formally noted as stem:[B > B'] if stem:[B] is a descendant of stem:[B'] in the block tree.
