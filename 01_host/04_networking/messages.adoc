[#sect-network-messages]
=== Network Messages

The Polkadot Host must actively communicate with the network in order to
participate in the validation process or act as a full node.

NOTE: The Polkadot network originally only used SCALE encoding for all message
formats. Meanwhile, Protobuf has been adopted for certain messages. The encoding
of each listed message is always SCALE encoded unless Protobuf is explicitly
mentioned. Encoding and message formats are subject to change.

[#sect-msg-block-announce]
==== Announcing blocks

When the node creates or receives a new block, it must be announced to the
network. Other nodes within the network will track this announcement and can
request information about this block. The mechanism for tracking announcements
and requesting the required data is implementation-specific.

Block announcements, requests and responses are sent over the substream as
described in <<defn-block-announce-handshake>>.

[#defn-block-announce-handshake]
.<<defn-block-announce-handshake,Block Announce Handshake>>
====
The `BlockAnnounceHandshake` initializes a substream to a remote peer. Once
established, all `BlockAnounce` messages (<<defn-block-announce>>) created by
the node are sent to the `/dot/block-announces/1` substream.

The `BlockAnnounceHandshake` is a structure of the following
format:

[stem]
++++
BA_h = "Enc"_("SC")(R, N_B, h_B, h_G)
++++

where:

[stem]
++++
R = {(1,"The node is a full node"),(2,"The node is a light client"),(4,"The node is a validator"):}\
N_B = "Best block number according to the node"\
h_B = "Best block hash according to the node"\
h_G = "Genesis block hash according to the node"
++++
====

[#defn-block-announce]
.<<defn-block-announce,Block Announce>>
====
The `BlockAnnounce` message is sent to the specified substream and indicates to
remote peers that the node has either created or received a new block.

The message is a structure of the following format:

[stem]
++++
BA = "Enc"_("SC")("Head"(B),b)
++++

where:

[stem]
++++
"Head"(B) = "Header of the announced block"\
b = {(0,"Is not part of the best chain"),(1,"Is the best block according to the node"):}
++++
====

[#sect-msg-block-request]
==== Requesting Blocks
Block requests can be used to retrieve a range of blocks from peers. Those
messages are sent over the `/dot/sync/2` substream.

[#defn-msg-block-request]

[#sect-msg-state-request]
==== Requesting States

The Polkadot Host can request the state in form of a key/value list at a
specified block.

When receiving state entries from the state response messages
(<<defn-msg-state-response>>), the node can verify the entries with the entry
proof (id _1_ in _KeyValueStorage_) against the merkle root in the block header
(of the block specified in <<defn-msg-state-request>>). Once the state response
message claims that all entries have been sent (id _3_ in _KeyValueStorage_),
the node can use all collected entry proofs and validate it against the merkel
root to confirm that claim.

See the the synchronization section for more information (<<sect-network-sync>>).

[#defn-msg-state-request]
.<<defn-msg-state-request, State Request>>
====
A **state request** is sent to a peer to request the state at a specified block.
The message is a single 32-byte Blake2 hash which indicates the block from which
the sync should start.

Depending on what substream is used, he remote peer either sends back a state
response (<<defn-msg-state-response>>) on the `/dot/sync/2` substream or a warp
sync proof (<<defn-warp-sync-proof>>) on the `/dot/sync/warp`.
====

[#defn-msg-state-response]
.<<defn-msg-state-response, State Response>>
====
The **state response** is sent to the peer that initialized the state request
(<<defn-msg-state-request>>) and contains a list of key/value entries with an
associated proof. This response is sent continuously until all key/value pairs
have been submitted.

[#sect-msg-warp-sync]
==== Warp Sync

The warp sync protocols allows nodes to retrieve blocks from remote peers where
authority set changes occured. This can be used to speed up synchronization to
the latest state.

See the the synchronization section for more information (<<sect-network-sync>>).

[#defn-warp-sync-proof]
.<<defn-warp-sync-proof,Warp Sync Proof>>
====
The **warp sync proof** message, stem:[P], is sent to the peer that initialized
the state request (<<defn-msg-state-request>>) on the `/dot/sync/warp` substream
and contains accumulated proof of multiple authority set changes
(<<sect-consensus-message-digest>>). It's a datastructure of the following
format:

[stem]
++++
P = (f_x...f_y, c)
++++

stem:[f_x...f_y] is an array consisting of warp sync fragments of the following format:

[stem]
++++
f_x = (B_h, J^(r,"stage")(B))
++++

where stem:[B_h] is the last block header containing a digest item
(<<defn-digest>>) signaling an authority set change from which the next
authority set change can be fetched from. stem:[J^(r,"stage")(B)] is the GRANDPA
justification (<<defn-grandpa-justification>>) and stem:[c] is a boolean that
indicates whether the warp sync has been completed.
====

[#sect-msg-transactions]
==== Transactions

Transactions (<<sect-extrinsics>>) are sent directly to peers with which the
Polkadot Host has an open transaction substream (<<defn-transactions-message>>).
Polkadot Host implementers should implement a mechanism that only sends a
transaction once to each peer and avoids sending duplicates. Sending duplicate
transactions might result in undefined consequences such as being blocked for
bad behaviour by peers.

The mechanism for managing transactions is further described in Section
<<sect-extrinsics>>.

[#defn-transactions-message]
.<<defn-transactions-message,Transaction Message>>
====
The *transactions message* is the structure of how the transactions are sent
over the network. It is represented by stem:[M_T] and is defined as follows:

[stem]
++++
M_T := "Enc"_("SC")(C_1,...,C_n)
++++

in which:

[stem]
++++
C_i := "Enc"_("SC")(E_i)
++++

Where each stem:[E_i] is a byte array and represents a separate
extrinsic. The Polkadot Host is agnostic about the content of an
extrinsic and treats it as a blob of data.

Transactions are sent over the `/dot/transactions/1` substream.
====

The *GRANDPA compact justification format* is an optimized data structure to
store a collection of pre-commits and their signatures to be submitted as part
of a commit message. Instead of storing an array of justifications, it uses the
following format:

[#sect-grandpa-catchup-messages]
===== GRANDPA Catch-up Messages

Whenever a Polkadot node detects that it is lagging behind the finality
procedure, it needs to initiate a _catch-up_ procedure. GRANDPA Neighbor
messages (<<defn-grandpa-neighbor-msg>>) reveal the round number for the last
finalized GRANDPA round which the node’s peers have observed. This provides the
means to identify a discrepancy in the latest finalized round number observed
among the peers. If such a discrepancy is observed, the node needs to initiate
the catch-up procedure explained in <<sect-grandpa-catchup>>).

In particular, this procedure involves sending a _catch-up request_ and
processing _catch-up response_ messages.

[#sect-network-sync]
=== Synchronization

IMPORTANT: Synchronization is mostly application specific and the protocol does not
mandate how synchronization must be conducted. The network messages are
specified in <<sect-network-messages>>. This section makes some recommendations
how a synchronization mechanism can be constructed.

Many applications that interact with the Polkadot network to some extent must be
able to retrieve certain information about the network. Depending on the
utility, this includes validators that interact with Polkadot's consensus and
need access to the full state, either from the past or just the most up-to-date
state, or light clients that are only interest in the minimum information
required in order to verify some claims about the state of the network, such as
the balance of a specific account. To allow implemenations to quickly retrieve
the required information, different types of synchronization protocols are
available, respectivel Full, Fast and Warp sync suited for different needs.

==== Full Sync

The full sync protocols is the "default" protocol that's suited for many types
of implementations, such as archive nodes (nodes that store everything),
validators that participate in Polkadots consensus and light clients that only
verify claims about the state of the network. Full sync works by listening to
announced blocks (<<sect-msg-block-announce>>) and requesting the blocks from
the announcing peers , or just the block headers in case of light clients.

The full sync protocol usually downloads the entire chain, but no such
requirements must be met. If an implemenation only wants the latest, finalized
state, it can combine it with protocols such as fast sync (<<sect-fast-sync>>)
and/or warp sync (<<sect-warp-sync>>) to make synchronization as fast as
possible.

[#sect-fast-sync]
==== Fast Sync

Fast sync works by downloading the block header history and validating the
auhtority set changes (<<sect-authority-set>>) in order to arrive at a specific
(usually the most recent) header. After the desired header has been reached and
verified, the state can be downloaded and imported (<<sect-msg-state-request>>).
Once this process has been completed, the node can proceed with a full sync.

[#sect-warp-sync]
==== Warp Sync

Warp sync (<<sect-msg-warp-sync>>) only downloads the block headers where
authority set changes occured, so called fragments (<<defn-warp-sync-proof>>),
and by verifying the GRANDPA justifications (<<defn-grandpa-justification>>).
This protocols allows nodes to arrive at the desired state much faster than fast
sync.
