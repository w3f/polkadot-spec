=== Light Client Messages

Light clients are applications that fetch the required data that they need from
a Polkadot node with an associated proof to validate the data. This makes it
possible to interact with the Polkadot network without requiring to run a full
node or having to trust the remote peers. The light client messages make this
functionality possible.

All light client messages are protobuf encoded and are sent over the
`/dot/light/2` substream.
