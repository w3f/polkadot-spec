With the current document, we aim to specify the Polkadot Host part of the
Polkadot protocol as a replicated state machine. After defining the different
types of hosts in <<chap-overview>>, we proceed to specify the representation of a
valid state of the Protocol in <<chap-state>>. We also identify the
protocol states, by explaining the Polkadot state transition and discussing the
detail based on which the Polkadot Host interacts with the state transition
function, i.e. Runtime in the same chapter. Following, we specify the input messages triggering the
state transition and the system behavior. In <<chap-networking>>, we specify
the communication protocols and network messages required for the Polkadot Host
to communicate with other nodes in the network, such as exchanging blocks and
consensus messages. In <<sect-block-production>> and <<sect-finality>>, we specify the consensus protocol,
which is responsible for keeping all the replica in the same state. Finally, the
initial state of the machine is identified and discussed in <<chapter-genesis>>.
A Polkadot Host implementation which conforms with this part of the
specification should successfully be able to sync its states with the Polkadot
network.
