=== Candidate Validation

Received candidates submitted by collators and must have its validity verified
by the assigned Polkadot validators. For each candidate to be valid, the
validator must successfully verify the following conditions in the following
order:

. The candidate does not exceed any parameters in the persisted validation data
(<<defn-persisted-validation-data>>).
. The signature of the collator is valid.
. Validate the candidate by executing the parachain Runtime (<<sect-parachain-runtime>>).

If all steps are valid, the Polkadot validator must create the necessary
candidate commitments (<<defn-candidate-commitments>>) and submit the
appropriate statement for each candidate
(<<sect-candidate-statements>>).

[#sect-parachain-runtime]
==== Parachain Runtime

Parachain Runtimes are stored in the relay chain state, and can either be
fetched by the parachain Id or the Runtime hash via the relay chain Runtime API
as described in <<sect-rt-api-validation-code>> and
<<sect-rt-api-validation-code-by-hash>> respectively. The retrieved parachain
Runtime might need to be decompressed based on the magic identifier as described
in <<sect-runtime-compression>>.

In order to validate a parachain block, the Polkadot validator must prepare the
validation parameters (<<defn-validation-parameters>>), then use its local Wasm
execution environment (<<sect-code-executor>>) to execute the validate_block
parachain Runtime API by passing on the validation parameters as an argument.
The parachain Runtime function returns the validation result
(<<defn-validation-result>>).

[#defn-validation-parameters]

====
The validation parameters structure, stem:[P], is required to validate a
candidate against a parachain Runtime. It's a datastructure of the following
format:

[stem]
++++
P = (h,b,B_i,S_r)
++++

where::
* stem:[h] is the parachain head data (<<defn-head-data>>).
* stem:[b] is the block body (<<defn-para-block>>).
* stem:[B_i] is the latest relay chain block number.
* stem:[S_r] is the relay chain block storage root (<<sect-merkl-proof>>).

[#defn-validation-result]
.<<defn-validation-result, Validation Result>>
====
The validation result is returned by the `validate_block` parachain Runtime API
after attempting to validate a parachain block. Those results are then used in
candidate commitments (<<defn-candidate-commitments>>), which then will be
inserted into the relay chain via the parachain inherent data
(<<defn-parachain-inherent-data>>). The validation result, stem:[V], is a
datastructure of the following format:

[stem]
++++
V   = (h,R,M_u,M_h,p_,w)\
M_u = (m_0,…m_n)\
M_h = (t_0,…t_n)
++++

where::
* stem:[h] is the parachain head data (<<defn-head-data>>).
* stem:[R] is an _Option_ value (<<defn-option-type>>) that can contain a new
parachain Runtime in case of an update.
* stem:[M_u] is an array of upward messages sent by the parachain. Each
individual message, m, is an array of bytes.
* stem:[M_h] is an array of individual outbound horizontal messages
(<<defn-outbound-hrmp-message>>) sent by the parachain.
* stem:[p] is a unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the number of downward
messages that were processed by the parachain. It is expected that the parachain
processes the messages from first to last.
* stem:[w] is a unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the watermark which specifies
the relay chain block number up to which all inbound horizontal messages have
been processed.
