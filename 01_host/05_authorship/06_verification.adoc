= Verifying Authorship Right

When a Polkadot node receives a produced block, it needs to verify if the block
producer was entitled to produce the block in the given slot by running
<<algo-verify-authorship-right>>. <<algo-verify-slot-winner>> runs as part of the verification process,
when a node is importing a block.
