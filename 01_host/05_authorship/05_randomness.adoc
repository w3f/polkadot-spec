[#sect-epoch-randomness]
= Epoch Randomness
At the beginning of each epoch, stem:[cc E_n] the host will receive the
randomness seed stem:[cc R_(cc E_(n+1))] (<<defn-epoch-randomness>>)
necessary to participate in the block production lottery in the next epoch
stem:[cc E_(n+1)] from the Runtime, through the consensus message
(<<defn-consensus-message-babe>>) in the digest of the first block.

====
For epoch stem:[cc E], there is a 32-byte stem:[cc R_(cc E)] computed based on
the previous epochs VRF outputs. For stem:[cc E_0] and stem:[cc E_1], the
randomness seed is provided in the genesis state (<<sect-rte-babeapi-epoch>>).
For any further epochs, the randomness is retrieved from the consensus message
(<<defn-consensus-message-babe>>).
