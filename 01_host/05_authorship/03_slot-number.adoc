= Slot Number Calculation

It is imperative for the security of the network that each block producer
correctly determines the current slot numbers at a given time by regularly
estimating the local clock offset in relation to the network
(<<defn-relative-synchronization>>).

****
IMPORTANT: *The calculation described in this section is still to be implemented and
deployed*: For now, each block producer is required to synchronize its local
clock using NTP instead. The current slot stem:[s] is then calculated by stem:[s
= t_"unix"/cc T] where stem:[cc T] is defined in <<defn-epoch-slot>> and
stem:[t_"unix"] is defined in <<defn-unix-time>>. That also entails that slot
numbers are currently not reset at the beginning of each epoch.

Polkadot does this synchronization without relying on any external clock source
(e.g. through the or the ). To stay in synchronization, each producer is
therefore required to periodically estimate its local clock offset in relation
to the rest of the network.

This estimation depends on the two fixed parameters stem:[k]
(<<defn-prunned-best>>) and stem:[s_(cq)] (<<defn-chain-quality>>). These are
chosen based on the results of a
https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/block-production/Babe.html#-5.-security-analysis[formal
security analysis], currently assuming a stem:[1 s] clock drift per day and
targeting a probability lower than stem:[0.5%] for an adversary to break BABE in
3 years with resistance against a network delay up to stem:[1 / 3] of the slot
time and a Babe constant (<<defn-babe-constant>>) of stem:[c = 0.38].

All validators are then required to run <<algo-slot-time>> at the beginning of
each sync period (<<defn-sync-period>>) to update their synchronization using
all block arrival times of the previous period. The algorithm should only be
run once all the blocks in this period have been finalized, even if only
probabilistically (<<defn-prunned-best>>). The target slot to which to
synchronize should be the first slot in the new sync period.

[#defn-slot-offset]
.<<defn-slot-offset, Slot Offset>>
====
Let stem:[s_i] and stem:[s_j] be two slots belonging to epochs stem:[cc E_k]
and stem:[cc E_l]. By *Slot-Offset*stem:[(s_i,s_j)] we refer to the function
whose value is equal to the number of slots between stem:[s_i] and stem:[s_j]
(counting stem:[s_j]) on the time continuum. As such, we have
*Slot-Offset*stem:[(s_i, s_i) = 0].

estimating the local clock offset in relation to the network
(<<defn-relative-synchronization>>).

[#defn-relative-synchronization]
.<<defn-relative-synchronization, Relative Time Synchronization>>
====
The *relative time synchronization* is a tuple of a slot number and a local
clock timestamp stem:[(s_"sync",t_"sync")] describing the last point at
which the slot numbers have been synchronized with the local clock.

[#defn-prunned-best]
.<<defn-prunned-best, Pruned Best Chain>>
====
The *pruned best chain* stem:[C^(r^k)] is the longest selected chain
(<<defn-longest-chain>>) with the last stem:[k] Blocks pruned. We chose
stem:[k= 140]. The *last (probabilistic) finalized block* describes the last block in
this pruned best chain.
====

[#defn-chain-quality]
.<<defn-chain-quality, Chain Quality>>
====
The *chain quality* stem:[s_(cq)] represents the number of slots that are used
to estimate the local clock offset. Currently, it is set to stem:[s_(cq) =
3000].

The prerequisite for such a calculation is that each producer stores the arrival
time of each block (<<defn-block-time>>) measured by a clock that is otherwise
not adjusted by any external protocol.
====

[#defn-block-time]
.<<defn-block-time, Block Arrival Time>>
====
The *block arrival time* of block stem:[B] for node stem:[j] formally
represented by stem:[T_B^j] is the local time of node stem:[j] when node
stem:[j] has received block stem:[B] for the first time. If the node stem:[j]
itself is the producer of stem:[B], stem:[T_B^j] is set equal to the time that
the block is produced. The index stem:[j] in stem:[T_B^j] notation may be
dropped and Bâ€™s arrival time is referred to by stem:[T_B] when there is no
ambiguity about the underlying node.
====

[#defn-sync-period]
.<<defn-sync-period, Sync Period>>
====
A is an interval at which each validator (re-)evaluates its local clock offsets.
The first sync period stem:[fr E_1] starts just after the genesis block is
released. Consequently, each sync period stem:[fr E_i] starts after stem:[fr
E_(i - 1)]. The length of the sync period (<<defn-chain-quality>>) is equal to
stem:[s_(qc)]and expressed in the number of slots.
