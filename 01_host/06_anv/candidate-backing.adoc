[#sect-candidate-backing]
=== Candidate Backing

The Polkadot validator receives an arbitrary number of parachain candidates with
associated proofs from untrusted collators. The assigned validators of each
parachain (<<defn-validator-groups>>) must verify and select a specific quantity
of the proposed candidates and issue those as backable candidates to its peers.
A candidate is considered backable when at least 2/3 of all assigned validators
have issued a _Valid_ statement about that candidate, as described in
<<sect-candidate-statements>>. Validators can retrieve information about
assignments via the Runtime APIs <<sect-rt-api-validator-groups>> respectively
<<sect-rt-api-availability-cores>>.

[#sect-candidate-statements]
==== Statements

The assigned validator checks the validity of the proposed parachains blocks
(<<sect-candidate-validation>>) and issues _Valid_ statements
(<<defn-statement>>) to its peers if the verification succeeded.
Broadcasting failed verification as _Valid_ statements is a slashable offense. The
validator must only issue one _Seconded_ statement, based on an arbitrary metric,
which implies an explicit vote for a candidate to be included in the relay
chain.

This protocol attempts to produce as many backable candidates as possible, but
does not attempt to determine a final candidate for inclusion. Once a parachain
candidate has been seconded by at least one other validator and enough Valid
statements have been issued about that candidate to meet the 2/3 quorum, the
candidate is ready to be included in the relay chain
(<<sect-candidate-inclusion>>).

The validator issues validity statements votes in form of a validator protocol
message (<<net-msg-validator-protocol-message>>).

A statement, stem:[S], is a datastructure of the following format:

[stem]
++++
S = (d,A_i,A_s)\
d = {(1,->,C_r),(2,->,C_h):}
++++

where

* stem:[d] is a varying datatype where _1_ indicates that the validator
“seconds” a candidate, meaning that the candidate should be included in the
relay chain, followed by the committed candidate receipt
(<<defn-committed-candidate-receipt>>), stem:[C_r]. _2_ indicates that the
validator has deemed the candidate valid, followed by the candidate hash.
* stem:[C_h] is the candidate hash.
* stem:[A_i] is the validator index in the authority set that signed this statement.
* stem:[A_s] is the signature of the validator.

[#sect-candidate-inclusion]
==== Inclusion

The Polkadot validator includes the backed candidates as parachain inherent data
(<<defn-parachain-inherent-data>>) into a block as described <<sect-inherents>>.
The relay chain block author decides on whatever metric which candidate should
be selected for inclusion, as long as that candidate is valid and meets the
validity quorum of 2/3+ as described in <<sect-candidate-statements>>. The
candidate approval process (<<sect-approval-voting>>) ensures that only relay
chain blocks are finalized where each candidate for each availability core meets
the requirement of 2/3+ availability votes.

[#defn-parachain-inherent-data]
.<<defn-parachain-inherent-data, Parachain Inherent Data>>
====
The parachain inherent data contains backed candidates and is included when
authoring a relay chain block. The datastructure, stem:[I], is of the following
format:

[stem]
++++
I = (A,T,D,P_h)\
T = (C_0,…C_n)\
D = (*d_n,…d_m)\
C = (R,V,i)\
V = (a_n,…a_m)\
a = {(1,->,s),(2,->,s):}\
A = (L_n,…L_m)\
L = (b,v_i,s)
++++

where

*  stem:[A] is an array of signed bitfields by validators claiming the candidate
is available (or not). The array must be sorted by validator index corresponding
to the authority set (<<defn-authority-list>>).
*  stem:[T] is an array of backed candidates for inclusing in the current block.
*  stem:[D] is an array of disputes.
*  stem:[P_h] is the parachain parent head data (<<defn-head-data>>).
*  stem:[d] is a dispute statement (<<net-msg-dispute-request>>).
*  stem:[R] is a committed candidate receipt (<<defn-committed-candidate-receipt>>).
*  stem:[V] is an array of validity votes themselves, expressed as signatures.
*  stem:[i] is a bitfield of indices of the validators within the validator
group (<<defn-validator-groups>>).
*  stem:[a] is either an implicit or explicit attestation of the validity of a
parachain candidate, where _1_ implies an implicit vote (in correspondence of a
_Seconded_ statement) and _2_ implies an explicit attestation (in correspondence
of a _Valid_ statement). Both variants are followed by the signature of the
validator.
*  stem:[s] is the signature of the validator.
*  stem:[b] the availability bitfield (<<sect-availability-votes>>).
*  stem:[v_i] is the validator index of the authority set (<<defn-authority-list>>).

[#defn-candidate-receipt]
.<<defn-candidate-receipt, Candidate Receipt>>
====
A candidate receipt, stem:[R], contains information about the candidate and a
proof of the results of its execution. It's a datastructure of the following
format:

[stem]
++++
R = (D,C_h)
++++

where stem:[D] is the candidate descriptor (<<defn-candidate-descriptor>>) and
stem:[C_h] is the hash of candidate commitments
(<<defn-candidate-commitments>>).

[#defn-committed-candidate-receipt]
.<<defn-committed-candidate-receipt, Committed Candidate Receipt>>
====
The committed candidate receipt, stem:[R], contains information about the
candidate and the the result of its execution that is included in the relay
chain. This type is similar to the candidate receipt
(<<defn-candidate-receipt>>), but actually contains the execution results rather
than just a hash of it. It's a datastructure of the following format:

[stem]
++++
R = (D,C)
++++

where stem:[D] is the candidate descriptor (<<defn-candidate-descriptor>>) and
stem:[C] is the candidate commitments (<<defn-candidate-commitments>>).
====

[#defn-candidate-descriptor]
.<<defn-candidate-descriptor, Candidate Descriptor>>
====
The candidate descriptor, stem:[D], is a unique descriptor of a candidate
receipt. It's a datastructure of the following format:

[stem]
++++
D = (p,H,C_i,V,B,r,s,p_h,R_h)
++++

where

* stem:[p] is the parachain Id (<<defn-para-id>>).
* stem:[H] is the hash of the relay chain block the candidate is executed in the context of.
* stem:[C_i] is the collators public key.
* stem:[V] is the hash of the persisted validation data (<<defn-persisted-validation-data>>).
* stem:[B] is the hash of the PoV block.
* stem:[r] is the root of the block's erasure encoding Merkle tree.
* stem:[s] the collator signature of the concatenated components stem:[p],
stem:[H], stem:[R_h] and stem:[B].
* stem:[p_h] is the hash of the parachain head data (<<defn-head-data>>) of this candidate.
* stem:[R_h] is the hash of the parachain Runtime.
====

[#defn-candidate-commitments]
.<<defn-candidate-commitments, Candidate Commitments>>
====
The candidate commitments, stem:[C], is the result of the execution and
validation of a parachain (or parathread) candidate whose produced values must
be committed to the relay chain. Those values are retrieved from the validation
result (<<defn-validation-result>>). A candidate commitment is a datastructure
of the following format:

[stem]
++++
C =(M_u,M_h,R,h,p,w)
++++

where:

* stem:[M_u] is an array of upward messages sent by the parachain. Each
individual message, m, is an array of bytes.
* stem:[M_h] is an array of individual outbound horizontal messages
(<<defn-outbound-hrmp-message>>) sent by the parachain.
* stem:[R] is an _Option_ value (<<defn-option-type>>) that can contain a new
parachain Runtime in case of an update.
* stem:[h] is the parachain head data (<<defn-head-data>>).
* stem:[p] is a unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the number of downward
messages that were processed by the parachain. It is expected that the parachain
processes the messages from first to last.
* stem:[w] is a unsigned 32-bit integer indicating the watermark which specifies
the relay chain block number up to which all inbound horizontal messages have
been processed.
