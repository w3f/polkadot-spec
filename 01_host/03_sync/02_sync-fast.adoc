[#sect-sync-fast]
= Fast Sync

Fast sync works by downloading the block header history and validating the
auhtority set changes (<<sect-authority-set>>) in order to arrive at a specific
(usually the most recent) header. After the desired header has been reached and
verified, the state can be downloaded and imported (<<sect-msg-state-request>>).
Once this process has been completed, the node can proceed with a full sync.
