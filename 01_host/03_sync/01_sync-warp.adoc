[#sect-sync-warp]
= Warp Sync

Warp sync (<<#sect-msg-warp-sync>>) only downloads the block headers where authority set changes occurred, so called fragments (<<defn-warp-sync-proof>>), and by verifying the GRANDPA justifications (<<defn-grandpa-justifications-compact>>). This protocols allows nodes to arrive at the desired state much faster than fast sync.
