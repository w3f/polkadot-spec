Many applications that interact with the Polkadot network to some extent must be
able to retrieve certain information about the network. Depending on the
utility, this includes validators that interact with Polkadot's consensus and
need access to the full state, either from the past or just the most up-to-date
state, or light clients that are only interest in the minimum information
required in order to verify some claims about the state of the network, such as
the balance of a specific account. To allow implemenations to quickly retrieve
the required information, different types of synchronization protocols are
available, respectivel Full, Fast and Warp sync suited for different needs.

The associated network messages are specified in <<sect-network-messages>>.
