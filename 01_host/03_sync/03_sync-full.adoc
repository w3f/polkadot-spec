= Full Sync

The full sync protocols is the "default" protocol that's suited for many types
of implementations, such as archive nodes (nodes that store everything),
validators that participate in Polkadots consensus and light clients that only
verify claims about the state of the network. Full sync works by listening to
announced blocks (<<sect-msg-block-announce>>) and requesting the blocks from
the announcing peers, or just the block headers in case of light clients.

The full sync protocol usually downloads the entire chain, but no such
requirements must be met. If an implemenation only wants the latest, finalized
state, it can combine it with protocols such as fast sync (<<sect-sync-fast>>)
and/or warp sync (<<sect-sync-warp>>) to make synchronization as fast as
possible.
