= Forced Authority Set Changes

In a case of emergency where the Polkadot network is unable to finalize blocks,
such as in an event of mass validator outage, the Polkadot governance mechanism
must enact a forced change, which the Host must handle in a specific manner.
Given that in such a case finality cannot be relied on, the Host must detect the
forced change (<<defn-consensus-message-digest>>) in a (valid) block and apply
it to all forks.

The stem:[m in CM_g], which is specified by the governance mechanism, defines
the starting block at which stem:[N_("delay")] is applied. This provides some
degree of probabilistic consensus to the network with the assumption that the
forced change was received by most participants and that finality can be
continued.
