= Rejoining the Same Voter Set

When a voter node rejoins the network after a disconnect from the voter set and
with the condition that there has been no change to the voter set at the time of
the disconnect, the node must continue performing the GRANDPA protocol at the
same state as before getting disconnected from the network, ignoring any
possible progress in GRANDPA finalization. Following reconnection, the node
eventually gets updated to the current GRANDPA round and synchronizes its state
with the rest of the voting set through the process called Catchup
(<<sect-grandpa-catchup>>).
