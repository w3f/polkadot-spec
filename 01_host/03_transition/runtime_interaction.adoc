Like any transaction-based transition system, Polkadotâ€™s state is changed by
executing an ordered set of instructions. These instructions are known as
_extrinsics_. In Polkadot, the execution logic of the state transition function
is encapsulated in a Runtime (<<defn-state-machine>>). For easy upgradability
this Runtime is presented as a Wasm blob. Nonetheless, the Polkadot Host needs
to be in constant interaction with the Runtime (<<sect-entries-into-runtime>>).

In <<sect-extrinsics>>, we specify the procedure of the process where the
extrinsics are submitted, pre-processed and validated by Runtime and queued to
be applied to the current state.

To make state replication feasible, Polkadot journals and batches series of its
extrinsics together into a structure known as a _block_, before propagating them
to other nodes, similar to most other prominent distributed ledger systems. The
specification of the Polkadot block as well as the process of verifying its
validity are both explained in <<sect-state-replication>>.

=== Interacting with the Runtime

The Runtime (<<defn-state-machine>>) is the code implementing the logic of the chain.
This code is decoupled from the Polkadot Host to make the the logic of the chain
easily upgradable without the need to upgrade the Polkadot Host itself. The
general procedure to interact with the Runtime is described by the algorithm as
defined in <<algo-runtime-interaction>>.

[#algo-runtime-interaction]
==== Algorithm: Interact-With-Runtime
****
Algorithm: stem:["Interact-With-Runtime"(F, H_b(B),(A_1,...,A_n))]

where

* stem:[F] is the runtime entry call.
* stem:[H_b(B)] is the block hash indicating the state at the end of stem:[B].
* stem:[A_1,...,A_n] are arguments to be passed to the runtime entry.

which executes the following steps:

. stem:[S_b larr "Set-State-At"(H_b(B))]
. stem:[A larr "Enc"_(SC)(A_1,...,A_n)]
. stem:["Call-Runtime-Entry"(R_B,RE_B,F,A,A_(len))]

****

In this section, we describe the details upon which the Polkadot Host is
interacting with the Runtime. In particular, stem:["Set-State-At"] and
stem:["Call-Runtime-Entry"] procedures called by the algorithm as defined in
<<algo-runtime-interaction>> are explained in <<notat-call-into-runtime>> and
<<defn-set-state-at>> respectively. stem:[R_B] is the Runtime code loaded from
stem:[S_B], as described in <<notat-runtime-code-at-state>>, and stem:[RE_B] is
the Polkadot Host API, as described in <<nota-host-api-at-state>>.

[#sect-loading-runtime-code]
==== Loading the Runtime Code

The Polkadot Host expects to receive the code for the Runtime of the
chain as a compiled WebAssembly (Wasm) Blob. The current runtime is
stored in the state database under the key represented as a byte array:

[stem]
++++
b := "3A,63,6F,64,65"
++++

which is the ASCII byte representation of the string `:code`
(<<chapter-genesis>>). As a result of storing the Runtime as part of the state,
the Runtime code itself becomes state sensitive and calls to Runtime can change
the Runtime code itself. Therefore the Polkadot Host needs to always make sure
to provide the Runtime corresponding to the state in which the entry has been
called. Accordingly, we define stem:[R_B] (<<notat-runtime-code-at-state>>).

The initial Runtime code of the chain is provided as part of the genesis state
(<<chapter-genesis>>) and subsequent calls to the Runtime have the ability to,
in turn, upgrade the Runtime by replacing this Wasm blob with the help of the
storage API (<<sect-storage-api>>).

[#notat-runtime-code-at-state]
===== Notation: Runtime Code at State
****
By stem:[R_B], we refer to the Runtime code stored in the state storage at the
end of the execution of block stem:[B].
****

[#sect-code-executor]
==== Code Executor

The Polkadot Host executes the calls of Runtime entries inside a Wasm
Virtual Machine (VM), which in turn provides the Runtime with access to
the Polkadot Host API. This part of the Polkadot Host is referred to as
the _Executor_.

<<notat-call-into-runtime>> introduces the notation for calling the runtime entry
which is used whenever an algorithm of the Polkadot Host needs to access the
runtime.

It is acceptable behavior that the Runtime panics during execution of a
function in order to indicate an error. The Polkadot Host must be able
to catch that panic and recover from it.

In this section, we specify the general setup for an Executor that calls into
the Runtime. In <<chap-runtime-api>> we specify the parameters and return values
for each Runtime entry separately.

[#notat-call-into-runtime]
===== Notation: Call Runtime Entry
****
By

[stem]
++++
"Call-Runtime-Entry"(R,RE,"Runtime-Entry",A,A_len)
++++

we refer to the task using the executor to invoke the while passing an
stem:[A_1, ..., A_n] argument to it and using the encoding described in
<<sect-runtime-send-args-to-runtime-enteries>>.
****

[#sect-memory-management]
===== Memory Management

The Polkadot Host is responsible for managing the WASM heap memory starting at
the exported symbol as a part of implementing the allocator Host API
(<<sect-allocator-api>>) and the same allocator should be used for any other
heap allocation to be used by the Polkadot Runtime.

The size of the provided WASM memory should be based on the value of the
storage key (an unsigned 64-bit integer), where each page has the size
of 64KB. This memory shoule be made available to the Polkadot Runtime
for import under the symbol name `memory`.

[#sect-runtime-send-args-to-runtime-enteries]
===== Sending Data to a Runtime Entry

In general, all data exchanged between the Polkadot Host and the Runtime is
encoded using SCALE codec described in <<sect-scale-codec>>. Therefore all
runtime entries have the following identical Wasm function signatures:

++++
(func $runtime_entry (param $data i32) (param $len i32) (result i64))
++++

In each invocation of a Runtime entry, the argument(s) which are supposed to be
sent to the entry, need to be SCALE encoded into a byte array stem:[B]
(<<sect-scale-codec>>) and copied into a section of Wasm shared memory managed
by the shared allocator described in <<sect-memory-management>>.

When the Wasm method , corresponding to the entry, is invoked, two
integers are passed as arguments. The first argument is set to the
memory adress of the byte array stem:[B] in Wasm memory. The
second argument sets the length of the encoded data stored in
stem:[B].

[#sect-runtime-return-value]
===== Receiving Data from a Runtime Entry

The value which is returned from the invocation is an integer,
representing two consecutive integers in which the least significant one
indicates the pointer to the offset of the result returned by the entry
encoded in SCALE codec in the memory buffer. The most significant one
provides the size of the blob.

[#sect-handling-runtime-state-update]
===== Handling Runtimes update to the State

In order for the Runtime to carry on various tasks, it manipulates the current
state by means of executing calls to various Polkadot Host APIs
(<<chap-host-api>>). It is the duty of Host APIs to determine the context in
which these changes should persist. For example, if Polkdot Host needs to
validate a transaction using entry (<<sect-rte-validate-transaction>>), it needs
to sandbox the changes to the state just for that Runtime call and prevent the
global state of the system from being influence by the call to such a Runtime
entry. This includes reverting the state of function calls which return errors
or panic.

As a rule of thumb, any state changes resulting from Runtime enteries are not
persistant with the exception of state changes resulting from calling
`Core_execute_block` (<<sect-rte-core-execute-block>>) while Polkadot Host is
importing a block (<<sect-block-validation>>).

For more information on managing multiple variant of state see
<<sect-managing-multiple-states>>.
