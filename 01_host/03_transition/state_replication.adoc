[#sect-state-replication]
=== State Replication

Polkadot nodes replicate each other’s state by syncing the history of the
extrinsics. This, however, is only practical if a large set of transactions are
batched and synced at the time. The structure in which the transactions are
journaled and propagated is known as a block of extrinsics
(<<sect-block-format>>). Like any other replicated state machines, state
inconsistency can occure between Polkadot replicas.
<<sect-managing-multiple-states>> gives an overview of how a Polkadot Host
node manages multiple variants of the state.

[#sect-block-format]
==== Block Format
A Polkadot block consists a _block header_ (<<defn-block-header>>) and a _block
body_ (<<defn-block-body>>). The _block body_ in turn is made up out of
_extrinsics_ , which represent the generalization of the concept of
_transactions_. _Extrinsics_ can contain any set of external data the underlying
chain wishes to validate and track.

[#defn-block-header]
.<<defn-block-header,Block Header>>
====
The *header of block B*, stem:[H_h(B)], is a 5-tuple containing the following
elements:

* *parent_hash:* formally indicated as stem:[H_p], is the 32-byte Blake2b hash
(<<sect-blake2>>) of the SCALE encoded parent block header
(<<defn-block-header-hash>>).
* *number:* formally indicated as stem:[H_i], is an integer, which represents
the index of the current block in the chain. It is equal to the number of the
ancestor blocks. The genesis state has number 0.
* *state_root:* formally indicated as stem:[H_r], is the root of the Merkle trie,
whose leaves implement the storage for the system.
* *extrinsics_root:* is the field which is reserved for the Runtime to validate
the integrity of the extrinsics composing the block body. For example, it can
hold the root hash of the Merkle trie which stores an ordered list of the
extrinsics being validated in this block. The [.sans-serif]#extrinsics_root# is
set by the runtime and its value is opaque to the Polkadot Host. This element is
formally referred to as stem:[H_e].
* *digest:* this field is used to store any chain-specific auxiliary data, which
could help the light clients interact with the block without the need of
accessing the full storage as well as consensus-related data including the block
signature. This field is indicated as stem:[H_d] (<<defn-digest>>).
====

[#defn-digest]
.<<defn-digest,Header Digest>>
====
The header *digest* of block stem:[B] formally referred to by stem:[H_d (B)] is
an array of *digest items* stem:[H_d^i]’s, known as digest items of varying data
type (<<defn-varrying-data-type>>) such that:

[stem]
++++
H_d(B) := H_d^1, ..., H_d^n
++++

where each digest item can hold one of the following type identifiers:

[stem]
++++
H_d^n = {
	(0,m),
	(4,(E_("id"),"CM")),
	(5,(E_("id"),S_B)),
	(6,(E_("id"),P)),
	(8,phi)
	:}
++++

Where stem:[E_(id)] is the unique consensus engine identifier
(<<defn-consensus-message-digest>>) and stem:[bbb B]:

* Id _0_, the *Non-System* digest, which is opaque to the native code. stem:[m] is
an opaque byte array.
* Id _4_, the *Consensus Message*, contains messages from the Runtime to the
consensus engine (<<sect-consensus-message-digest>>).
* Id _5_, the *Seal*, is the data produced by the consensus engine and proving
the authorship of the block producer. Respectively, stem:[S_B] is the signature
(<<defn-block-signature>>) of the block producer. In particular, the Seal digest
item must be the last item in the digest array and must be stripped off by the
Polkadot Host before the block is submitted to any Runtime function including
for validation. The Seal must be added back to the digest afterward.
* Id _6_, the *Pre-Runtime* digest, contains the BABE Pre-Digest item
(<<defn-babe-header>>).
* Id _8_, the *Runtime Environment Updated* digest, indicates that changes
regarding the Runtime code or heap pages (<<sect-memory-management>>) occured.
No additional data is provided.
====

[#defn-block-header-hash]
.<<defn-block-header-hash,Header Hash>>
====
The *block header hash of block stem:[B]*, stem:[H_h(B)], is the hash of the
header of block stem:[B] encoded by simple codec:

[stem]
++++
H_h(B) := "Blake2b"("Enc"_(SC)("Head"(B)))
++++
====

[#sect-justified-block-header]
===== Justified Block Header

The Justified Block Header is provided by the consensus engine and
presented to the Polkadot Host, for the block to be appended to the
blockchain. It contains the following parts:

* *block_header* the complete block header (<<defn-block-header>>) and denoted
by stem:["Head"(B)].
* *justification*: as defined by the consensus specification indicated by
stem:["Just"(B)] as defined in <<defn-grandpa-justification>>.
* *authority Ids*: This is the list of the Ids of authorities, which have voted
for the block to be stored and is formally referred to as stem:[A(B)]. An
authority Id is 256-bit.

[#defn-block-body]
.<<defn-block-body,Block Body>>
====
The block body consists of an sequence of extrinsics, each encoded as a byte
array. The content of an extrinsic is completely opaque to the Polkadot Host. As
such, from the point of the Polkadot Host, and is simply a SCALE encoded array
of byte arrays. The *body of Block* stem:[B] represented as stem:["Body"(B)] is
defined to be:

[stem]
++++
"Body"(B) := "Enc"_(SC)(E_1,...,E_n)
++++

Where each stem:[E_i in bbb B] is a SCALE encoded extrinsic.
====

[#sect-block-validation]
==== Importing and Validating Block

Block validation is the process by which a node asserts that a block is fit to
be added to the blockchain. This means that the block is consistent with the
current state of the system and transitions to a new valid state.

New blocks can be received by the Polkadot Host via other peers
(<<sect-msg-block-request>>) or from the Host’s own consensus engine
(<<sect-block-production>>). Both the Runtime and the Polkadot Host then need to
work together to assure block validity. A block is deemed valid if the block
author had authorship rights for the slot in which the block was produce as well
as if the transactions in the block constitute a valid transition of states. The
former criterion is validated by the Polkadot Host according to the block
production consensus protocol. The latter can be verified by the Polkadot Host
invoking entry into the Runtime as (<<sect-rte-core-execute-block>>) as a part
of the validation process. Any state changes created by this function on
successful execution are persisted.

The Polkadot Host implements the Algorithm as defined in
<<algo-import-and-validate-block>> to assure the validity of the block.

[#algo-import-and-validate-block]
==== Import and Validate Block
****
Algorithm: stem:["Import-And-Validate-Block"(B, "Just"(B))]

. stem:["Set-State-At"(P(B))]
. stem:["if Just"(B) != 0]
. stem:["    " "Verify-Block-Justification"(B, "Just"(B))]
. stem:["    " "if " B " is Finalized and " P(B) " is not Finalized"]
. stem:["    " "     " "Mark-As-Final"(P(B))]
. stem:["if " H_p(B) !in "PBT"]

. stem:[B larr "Add-Seal"(B)]
. stem:["if " R = "true"]
. stem:["    " "Persist-State"]

where:

* stem:["Remove-Seal"] removes the Seal digest from the block (<<defn-digest>>)
before submitting it to the Runtime.
* stem:["Add-Seal"] adds the Seal digest back to the block (<<defn-digest>>) for
later propagation.
* stem:["Persist-State"] implies the persistance of any state changes created by
stem:[tt "Core_execute_block"] (<<sect-rte-core-execute-block>>) on successful
execution.
* stem:["PBT"] is the pruned block tree (<<defn-block-tree>>).
* stem:["Verify-Authorship-Right"] is part of the block production consensus
protocol and is described in <<algo-verify-authorship-right>>.
* _Finalized block_ and _finality_ are defined in <<sect-finality>>.

[#sect-managing-multiple-states]
==== Managaing Multiple Variants of State

Unless a node is committed to only update its state according to the finalized
block (<<defn-finalized-block>>), it is inevitable for the node to store
multiple variants of the state (one for each block). This is, for example,
necessary for nodes participating in the block production and finalization.

While the state trie structure (<<sect-state-storage-trie-structure>>)
facilitates and optimizes storing and switching between multiple variants of the
state storage, the Polkadot Host does not specify how a node is required to
accomplish this task. Instead, the Polkadot Host is required to implement
stem:["Set-State-At"] (<<defn-set-state-at>>):

[#defn-set-state-at]
.<<defn-set-state-at,Set State At Block>>
====
The function:

[stem]
++++
"Set-State-At"(B)
++++

in which stem:[B] is a block in the block tree (<<defn-block-tree>>), sets the
content of state storage equal to the resulting state of executing all
extrinsics contained in the branch of the block tree from genesis till block B
including those recorded in Block stem:[B].

For the definition of the state storage see <<sect-state-storage>>.
====

[#sect-changes-trie]
==== Changes Trie

IMPORTANT: Changes Tries are still work-in-progress and are currently *not* used
in Polkadot. Additionally, the implementation of Changes Tries might change
considerably.

Polkadot focuses on light client friendliness and therefore implements
functionalities that allows identifying changes in the state of the blockchain
without the requirement to search through the entire chain. The *Changes Trie*
is a radix-16 tree data structure (<<defn-radix-tree>>) and maintained by the
Polkadot Host. It stores different types of storage changes made by each
individual block separately.

The primary method for generating the Changes Trie is provided to the Runtime
with the Host API (<<sect-ext-storage-changes-root>>). The Runtime calls that
function shortly before finalizing the block, the Polkadot Host must then
generate the Changes Trie based on the storage changes which occured during
block production or execution. In order to provide this API function, it is
imperative that the Polkadot Host implements a mechanism to keep track of the
changes created by individual blocks, as mentioned in <<sect-state-storage>> and
<<sect-managing-multiple-states>>. The Changes Trie stores three different types
of changes.

The Changes Trie itself is not part of the block, but a separately maintained
database by the Polkadot Host. The Merkle proof of the Changes Trie must be
included in the block digest (<<defn-digest>>) and gets calculated as described
in <<sect-merkl-proof>>. The root calculation only considers pairs which were
generated on the individual block and does not consider pairs which were
generated at previous blocks.

NOTE: This seperately maintained database by the Polkadot Host is
intended to be used by "proof servers", where its implementation and behavior
has not been fully defined yet. This is considered future-reserved

As clarified in the individual sections of each type, not all of those types get
generated on every block. But if conditions apply, all those different types of
pairs get inserted into the same Changes Trie, therefore only one Changes Trie
Root gets generated for each block.

[#defn-change-trie-insert]
.<<defn-change-trie-insert, Inserted Key-Value Pairs>>
====
The *inserted key-value pair stored in the nodes of Changes Trie* is
formally defined as:

[stem]
++++
(K_C, V_C)
++++

Where stem:[K_C] is a SCALE-encoded tuple:

[stem]
++++
"Enc"_(SC)("Type"_(V_C), H_i(B_i),K)
++++

and

[stem]
++++
V_C = "Enc"_(SC)(C_(value))
++++

is a SCALE encoded byte array.

Furthermore, stem:[K] represents the changed storage key, stem:[H_i(B_i)] refers
to the block number at which this key is inserted into the Changes Trie
(<<defn-block-header>>) and stem:["Type"_(V_C)] is an index defining the type
stem:[C_(value)] according to:

[stem]
++++
C_(value) = {(1,(e_i,...,e_k)),(2,(H_i(B_k),...,H_i(B_m))),(3,H_r("Child-Changes-Trie")):}
++++

where:

* _1_ is a list of extrinsics indices and stem:[e_n] refers to the index of the extrinsic within the block.
* _2_ is a list of block numbers.
* _3_ is the child changes trie.
====

[#sect-changes-trie-extrinsics-pairs]
===== Key to extrinsics pairs

This key-value pair stores changes which occurred in an individual block. Its
value is a SCALE encoded array containing the indices of the extrinsics that
caused any changes to the specified key. The key-value pair is defined as
(clarified in <<sect-changes-trie>>):

[stem]
++++
(1, H_i (B_i), K) -> (e_i, ..., e_k)
++++

The indices are unsigned 32-bit integers and their values are based on the order
in which each extrinsics appears in the block (indexing starts at 0). The
Polkadot Host generates those pairs for every changed key on each and every
block. Child storages have their own Changes Trie
(<<sect-changes-trie-child-trie-pair>>).

[#sect-changes-trie-block-pairs]
===== Key to block pairs

This key-value pair stores changes which occurred in a certain range of blocks.
Its value is a SCALE encoded array containing block numbers in which extrinsics
caused any changes to the specified key. The key-value pair is defined as
(clarified in section <<sect-changes-trie>>):

[stem]
++++
(2, H_i (B_i), K) -> (H_i (B_k), ..., H_i (B_m))
++++

The block numbers are represented as unsigned 32-bit integers. There are
multiple "levels" of those pairs, and the Polkadot Host does *not* generate
those pairs on every block. The genesis state contains the key `:changes_trie`
where its unsigned 64-bit value is a tuple of two 32-bit integers:

* *interval* - The interval (in blocks) at which those pairs should be created.
If this value is less or equal to 1 it means that those pairs are not created at
all.
* *levels* - The maximum number of "levels" in the hierarchy. If this value is
0 it means that those pairs are not created at all.

For each level from 1 to _levels_, the Polkadot Host creates those pairs on
every -nth block.

For example, let’s say _interval_ is set at and is set at . This means there are
now three levels which get generated at three different occurrences:

. *Level 1* - Those pairs are generated at every stem:[4^1]-nth block, where the
pair value contains the block numbers of every block that changed the specified
storage key. This level only considers block numbers of the last four
(stem:[4^1]) blocks.
** Example: this level occurs at block 4, 8, 12, 16, 32, etc.
. *Level 2* - Those pairs are generated at every stem:[4^2]-nth block, where the
pair value contains the block numbers of every block that changed the specified
storage key. This level only considers block numbers of the last 16
(stem:[4^2]) blocks.
** Example: this level occurs at block 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc.
. *Level 3* - Those pairs are generated at every stem:[4^3]-nth block, where the
pair value contains the block numbers of every block that changed the specified
storage key. this level only considers block number of the last 64
(stem:[4^3]) blocks.
** Example: this level occurs at block 64, 128, 196, 256, 320, etc.

[#sect-changes-trie-child-trie-pair]
===== Key to Child Changes Trie pairs

The Polkadot Host generates a separate Changes Trie for each child storage,
using the same behavior and implementation as describe in
<<sect-changes-trie-extrinsics-pairs>>. Additionally, the changed child storage
key gets inserted into the primary, non-Child Changes Trie where its value is a
SCALE encoded byte array containing the Merkle root of the Child Changes Trie.
The key-value pair is defined as:

[stem]
++++
(3,H_i(B_i),K) -> H_r("Child-Changes-Trie")
++++

The Polkadot Host creates those pairs for every changes child key for each and
every block.
