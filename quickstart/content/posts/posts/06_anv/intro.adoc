Polkadot serves as a replicated shared-state machine designed to resolve
scalability issues and interoperability among blockchains. The validators of
Polkadot execute transactions and participate in the consensus of Polkadots
primary chain, the so called relay chain. Parachains are independent networks
that maintain their own state and are connected to the relay chain. Those
parachains can take advantage of the relay chain consensus mechanism, including
sending and receiving messages to and from other parachains. Parachain nodes
that send parachain blocks, known as candidates, to the validators in order to
be inlcuded in relay chain are referred to as collators.

The Polkadot relay chain validators are responsible for guaranteeing the
validity of both relay chain and parachain blocks. Additionally, the validators
are required to keep enough parachain blocks that should be included in the
relay chain available in their local storage in order to make those retrievable
by peers, who lack the information, to reliably confirm the issued validity
statements about parachain blocks. The Availability & Validity (AnV) protocol
consists of multiple steps for successfully upholding those responsibilities.

Parachain blocks themselves are produced by collators (<<sect-collations>>),
whereas the relay chain validators only verify their validity (and later, their
availability). It is possible that the collators of a parachain  produces
multiple parachain block candidates for a child of a specific block.
Subsequently, they send the block candidates to the the relay chain validators
who are assigned to the specific parachain. The assignment is determined by the
Runtime (<<sect-candidate-backing>>). Those validators are then required to
check the validity of submitted candidates (<<sect-candidate-validation>>), then
issue and collect statements (<<sect-candidate-statements>>) about the validity
of candidates to other validators. This process is known as candidate backing.
Once a candidate meets a specified criteria for inclusion, the selected relay
chain block author then choses any of the backed candidate for each parachain
and includes those into the relay chain block (<<sect-candidate-inclusion>>).

Every relay chain validator must fetch the proposed candidates and issue votes
on whether they have the candidate saved in their local storage, so called
availability votes (<<sect-availability-votes>>), then also collect the votes
sent by other validators and include them in the relay chain state
(<<sect-candidate-inclusion>>). This process ensures that only relay chain
blocks get finalized where each candidate is available on enough nodes of
validators.

Parachain candidates contained in non-finalized (Section ?) relay chain blocks
must then be retrieved by a secondary set of relay chain validators, unrelated
from the candidate backing process, who are randomly assigned to determine the
validity of specific parachains based on a VRF lottery and are then required to
vote on the validity of those candidates. This process is known as approval
voting (<<sect-approval-voting>>). If a validator does not have the candidate
data, it must recover the candidate data (<<sect-candidate-recovery>>).
