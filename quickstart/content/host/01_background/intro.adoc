Formally, Polkadot is a replicated sharded state machine designed to
resolve the scalability and interoperability among blockchains. In
Polkadot vocabulary, shards are called _parachains_ and Polkadot _relay
chain_ is part of the protocol ensuring global consensus among all the
parachains. The Polkadot relay chain protocol, henceforward called
_Polkadot protocol_, can itself be considered as a replicated state
machine on its own. As such, the protocol can be specified by
identifying the state machine and the replication strategy.

From a more technical point of view, the Polkadot protocol has been
divided into two parts, the _Runtime_ and the _Host_. The Runtime
comprises the state transition logic for the Polkadot protocol and is
designed and be upgradable via the consensus engine without requiring
hard forks of the blockchain. The Polkadot Host provides the
functionality for the Runtime to execute its state transition logic,
such as an execution environment, I/O and consensus, shared mostly among
peer-to-peer decentralized cryptographically-secured transaction
systems, i.e. blockchains whose consensus system is based on the
proof-of-stake. The Polkadot Host is planned to be stable and static for
the lifetime duration of the Polkadot protocol.

With the current document, we aim to specify the Polkadot Host part of the
Polkadot protocol as a replicated state machine. After defining the basic terms
in Chapter 1, we proceed to specify the representation of a valid state of the
Protocol in <<chap-state-spec>>. In <<chap-state-transit>>, we identify the
protocol states, by explaining the Polkadot state transition and discussing the
detail based on which the Polkadot Host interacts with the state transition
function, i.e. Runtime. Following, we specify the input messages triggering the
state transition and the system behaviour. In <<chap-networking>>, we specify
the communication protocols and network messages required for the Polkadot Host
to communicate with other nodes in the network, such as exchanging blocks and
consensus messages. In <<chap-consensus>>, we specify the consensus protocol,
which is responsible for keeping all the replica in the same state. Finally, the
initial state of the machine is identified and discussed in <<chapter-genesis>>.
A Polkadot Host implementation which conforms with this part of the
specification should successfully be able to sync its states with the Polkadot
network.
