= Polkadot Protocol

WARNING: This specification is *Work-In-Progress* and any content, structure,
design and/or hyper/anchor-link *is subject to change*.

Formally, Polkadot is a replicated sharded state machine designed to
resolve the scalability and interoperability among blockchains. In
Polkadot vocabulary, shards are called _parachains_ and Polkadot _relay
chain_ is part of the protocol ensuring global consensus among all the
parachains. The Polkadot relay chain protocol, henceforward called
_Polkadot protocol_, can itself be considered as a replicated state
machine on its own. As such, the protocol can be specified by
identifying the state machine and the replication strategy.

From a more technical point of view, the Polkadot protocol has been divided into
two parts, the <<part-polkadot-runtime>> and the <<part-polkadot-host>>. The Runtime comprises the state
transition logic for the Polkadot protocol and is designed and be upgradable via
the consensus engine without requiring hard forks of the blockchain. The
Polkadot Host provides the necessary functionality for the Runtime to execute
its state transition logic, such as an execution environment, I/O, consensus and
network interoperability between parachains. The Polkadot Host is planned to be
stable and mostly static for the lifetime duration of the Polkadot protocol, the
goal being that most changes to the protocol are primarily conducted by applying
Runtime updates and not having to coordinate with network participants on manual
software updates.
